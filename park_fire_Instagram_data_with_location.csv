"Pyrocumulonimbus Clouds are a type of storm cloud formed by a large source of heat such as a volcano, explosion, or wildfire. When you hear about fires ""creating their own weather"" this is one of those phenomena. The rapid ascension of hot air pulls in air from the bottom, causing rapid winds that can further fuel a fire. Cumulonimbus clouds can also generate hail, lightning, and in some cases even heavy precipitation.

"Chico Firefighters remain actively engaged in fighting the Park Fire. Crews have worked to improve and secure containment lines in Upper Bidwell Park as well as provide structure protection in Forest Ranch, Cohasset and North Chico communities.

The Park Fire has burned over 100,000 acres, destroyed structures and required evacuations throughout much of Northern Butte County. Chico Firefighters will remain committed to the incident and work to protect Chico as well as surrounding communities. 

Additional Chico Firefighters have been called upon to provide staffing throughout the city. Crews have responded to dozens of local emergencies over the last 36 hours. Crews have responded to various emergency types, including traffic collisions, vegetation fires, vehicle fires, utility hazards, medical aids and public assist requests. 

Additionally, Chico Firefighters responded to a working apartment complex fire along California Park Drive this afternoon. Engine 15 arrived first at scene and reported heavy fire showing from a second floor unit. The fire immediately threatened fifteen adjacent apartment units which are part of the same building. 

Crews initiated an aggressive interior attack and primary search for victims. Firefighters were able to quickly achieve knockdown and prevent damage to additional units. The majority of smoke and fire damage was held to the unit of origin and attic space. The primary search for victims was all clear and there were no reported injuries. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation. 

Chico Firefighters are proud to serve this community. We would like to thank CAL FIRE Butte County, Chico Police, Butte County Sheriff and the hundreds of California Firefighters who are responding to combat the Park Fire. We would also like to say a special thank you to all the community members and volunteer groups who have supported those affected by the Park Fire. We live in a great community and are privileged to be your firefighters.

"Heather and I startled when we saw smoke out our window. Walking across the street, we watched the flames tear across the canyon wall that we love seeing every day. It was frightening. The aircraft drops were constant, but the winds were howling. We live at the southern tip of what was soon named the “Park Fire”. At this time, our home is not in danger and we are safe. 

Triggered. Distressed. Anxious. Hopeful. Grieving. Incredulous. Lost. Confused. Shattered. Calling out “Butte Strong”, while personally collapsing.

Having lived through and worked in the Camp Fire recovery for the last 6 years, these are some of the new and dormant feelings being stirred in myself and our community. Today, people had to escape through fire, again. Neighbors in our town are losing homes, some permanently, some temporarily, again. Our hearts are, once again, overwhelmed and joined in support. 

Let’s give each other loving, patient space to be where we need to be. Let’s be reminded that loving kindness and empathy need to be at the center of who we are as humans. . #parkfire #lovewins",365853683968404.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C95Pxftt7ey/,Canyon Oaks,2024-07-26 17:35:03

I screenshot some photos from Action News Now, also Butte County Fires and Accidents, groups from fb.

The other photos are different locations in Chico, where I live.

I go to this park constantly, so if you have been following me for a while, you have seen this stunning place. Scroll to the end to see the park before the fire.

I've been wanting to make a video for a while showing all of my favorite trees in this town. Now, some of them will be gone forever.

Another lesson of, do not wait, because you might lose the opportunity.

I'm heartbroken for all the people who had to flee their homes and all the once stunning nature that has now turned to ash.

"As we watch #ParkFire burn in the Lassen foothills, I am appreciative of the outpouring of concern for our home, the Big Chico Creek Ecological Reserve, and communities of Forest Ranch and Cohasset. My family and I are safe and evacuated. We are grateful for a wonderful network of family and friends in this time of need.

Fuels, weather, and topography are basics in fire behavior, and sadly, the alignment from this arson fire in Upper Park has demonstrated that with rapid spread up-slope driven by wind in grass-dominated fuels made abundant with the last season’s rain. In the past two days, it has burned northward across the foothills with some lateral movement south and east. I can say the Big Chico Creek Ecological Reserve, where I am field director, burned with a mix of fire behavior and spread. The fire continues to burn in Big Chico Creek canyon along the eastern flank and through the Ishi Wilderness. This landscape – and those of us impacted will undoubtedly be changed by this fire, and sadly, we have likely lost many beloved personal, cultural, and ecological features. While many good plans were in the works to prevent this, we must focus on now and the future.

"⚠️ SAD BREAKING NEWS, PLEASE SHARE AND LETS PRAY FOR SURVIVORS!⚠️ An enormous wildfire, known as the Park Fire, has destroyed buildings, left several people injured, thousands of animals injured and killed and prompted evacuation orders for thousands of people as it tripled in size in just two days in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Northern California. As of Friday, the fire was only 3% contained by 1,100 firefighters battling the flames using helicopters and cutting fire lines with bulldozers in a desperate attempt to prevent the fire from spreading to homes in nearby densely populated areas. Already 130 homes were destroyed and the fire burned more than 164,000 acres, making it the state’s largest fire so far this year. Authorities said the fire was sparked by a man who pushed a burning car down a gully. Ronnie Dean Stout II, the arson suspect linked to starting the fire, was arrested and jailed without bail as Stout has two previous “strike” felony convictions, which will be charged along with whatever arson charge is determined by the evidence to be appropriate on Monday. This is tragic and we ask that you share this news with your followers and ask them to join with us in thanking the brave firefighters and praying for survivors, not only us humans, but also for the countless animals at risk due to this raging wildfire! #parkfire #wildfire #karmagawa",255700994.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C9525d0MN0H/,California,2024-07-26 23:16:56
"#parkfire AS OF TODAY 07/26/24 OVER  178,000 acres!! This hurts my heart 

ARSON: Registered Sex Offender Ronnie Dean Stout II (42) charged with starting the 71,489 acre and growing Park Fire
BCFAC News 7/25/2024 Oroville, CA - A 42-year-old Chico man was arrested early this morning by Cal Fire arson investigators, assisted by District Attorney investigators on suspicion of starting the Park Fire.

Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said the man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, was arrested after an unknown male was seen pushing a car that was on fire into a gully near the Alligator Hole in upper Bidwell Park shortly before 3:00 p.m. yesterday. 

The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire.

The male was then seen calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire. 

Cal Fire arson investigators responded immediately, secured the scene, and began to search for clues to the identity of the unknown man.

Stout has a prior record, including two ""strike"" felony convictions: a 2001 conviction in Butte County Superior Court for Lewd and Lascivious Acts with a Child under 14, and a 2002 conviction in Kern County Superior Court for Robbery with Great Bodily Injury. 

Following the 2002 conviction, Stout was sentenced to 20 years in State Prison.

The man was eventually identified and with the help of the DA’s Office, a warrant was issued by a local judge for him early this morning. 

He was booked into the Butte County Jail where, pursuant to the warrant, he is being held without bail until his arraignment on Monday of next week.

Ramsey said the investigation is ongoing and anyone who has information or was in the Alligator Hole area between the hours of noon and 3:00 p.m. is encouraged to call Cal Fire investigations at (530) 538-7888.",2356614.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C954a2AS4PG/,"Red Bluff, California",2024-07-26 23:30:13

"@chicofd Chico Firefighters remain actively engaged in fighting the Park Fire. Crews have worked to improve and secure containment lines in Upper Bidwell Park as well as provide structure protection in Forest Ranch, Cohasset and North Chico communities.

The Park Fire has burned over 100,000 acres, destroyed structures and required evacuations throughout much of Northern Butte County. Chico Firefighters will remain committed to the incident and work to protect Chico as well as surrounding communities. 

Additional Chico Firefighters have been called upon to provide staffing throughout the city. Crews have responded to dozens of local emergencies over the last 36 hours. Crews have responded to various emergency types, including traffic collisions, vegetation fires, vehicle fires, utility hazards, medical aids and public assist requests. 

Additionally, Chico Firefighters responded to a working apartment complex fire along California Park Drive this afternoon. Engine 15 arrived first at scene and reported heavy fire showing from a second floor unit. The fire immediately threatened fifteen adjacent apartment units which are part of the same building. 

Crews initiated an aggressive interior attack and primary search for victims. Firefighters were able to quickly achieve knockdown and prevent damage to additional units. The majority of smoke and fire damage was held to the unit of origin and attic space. The primary search for victims was all clear and there were no reported injuries. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation. 

Chico Firefighters are proud to serve this community. We would like to thank CAL FIRE Butte County, Chico Police, Butte County Sheriff and the hundreds of California Firefighters who are responding to combat the Park Fire. We would also like to say a special thank you to all the community members and volunteer groups who have supported those affected by the Park Fire. We live in a great community and are privileged to be your firefighters.

To reliving the camp fire (through a loved ones eyes). 

To praying for those who put themselves in harms way to protect us. 

To thankfulness for all those reaching out to make sure we are safe.

"It was very restless night tonight, the cool breezes began to blow, and I felt moved to leave the house at midnight. I needed to clear my head, so I drove into the darkness on backcountry roads with no destination in mind. My heavy heart felt lifted at least for a short while, the spirit in the sky gifted me with some very powerful captures of the moonlight. I’m not even sure how this photo even happened, but somehow magically it captured the emotions in my heart. As the wind is blowing outside my window, I pray. I pray for everyone who no longer has a home to return to. I pray for the brave people who are out in all of this, fighting to save us all.

"As we all stand by watching this fire grow beyond 300,000 acres in just a few days, our hearts are broken, angry and deeply worried about the extent of even more destruction and losses to come. Please remember during this time that no one is alone, and there is support available for you. 

We are so grateful for the fire fighters, emergency responders, and for all the local businesses, individuals and organizations that are stepping up and channeling all these emotions into action and care for our communities. We'll be posting them as we see them popping up.

"The Park Fire has become the worst blaze of the year by burning 178,000 acres as of Friday afternoon. Authorities allege that on Wednesday night, Ronnie Dean Stout, 42, set a car ablaze and pushed it into a ravine, igniting the inferno.

"Posted• @chicofd #californiafirefighter - Chico Firefighters remain actively engaged in fighting the Park Fire. Crews have worked to improve and secure containment lines in Upper Bidwell Park as well as provide structure protection in Forest Ranch, Cohasset and North Chico communities.

The Park Fire has burned over 100,000 acres, destroyed structures and required evacuations throughout much of Northern Butte County. Chico Firefighters will remain committed to the incident and work to protect Chico as well as surrounding communities. 

Additional Chico Firefighters have been called upon to provide staffing throughout the city. Crews have responded to dozens of local emergencies over the last 36 hours. Crews have responded to various emergency types, including traffic collisions, vegetation fires, vehicle fires, utility hazards, medical aids and public assist requests. 

Additionally, Chico Firefighters responded to a working apartment complex fire along California Park Drive this afternoon. Engine 15 arrived first at scene and reported heavy fire showing from a second floor unit. The fire immediately threatened fifteen adjacent apartment units which are part of the same building. 

Crews initiated an aggressive interior attack and primary search for victims. Firefighters were able to quickly achieve knockdown and prevent damage to additional units. The majority of smoke and fire damage was held to the unit of origin and attic space. The primary search for victims was all clear and there were no reported injuries. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation. 

Chico Firefighters are proud to serve this community. We would like to thank CAL FIRE Butte County, Chico Police, Butte County Sheriff and the hundreds of California Firefighters who are responding to combat the Park Fire. We would also like to say a special thank you to all the community members and volunteer groups who have supported those affected by the Park Fire. We live in a great community and are privileged to be your firefighters.

"The last slide is the alleged perp; I’ll say this with a straight face 

This 5 alarm worthless waste of space better get everything he deserves on this one. Living 25 miles from where the 2018 #campfire happened, in respect to many people I know that have been forever traumatized by the effects of that fire, by the 2019 #bearfire, by the recent #thompsonfire.. kills me, absolutely kills me.. to see anywhere burn, especially areas close to my home, my county, seeing my friends relive memories, their homes impacted/ their friends & fam impacted. Judicial system is such that “innocent until proven guilty” as they say. 

They’ve got pictures of the car.. pic of him walking away. Don’t envy the judge(s) overseeing this one. Started in Butte County, Tehama impacted.. likely inclusion of Lassen & Shasta. All I can say is.. THIS PIG BETTER GET THE FULL FORCE OF LAW THROWN AT HIM! 

All of the towns up here are their own areas but NorCal is United on this one. Thoughts & prayers to everyone impacted. May Justice be done & in doing so, give that Justice to EVERYONE & EVERYTHING IMPACTED & I MEAN EVERYONE & EVERYTHING.

"Words can’t come close to describing the range of emotions that my family and I have been through the past few days. I was on the phone with my mom as she and my stepdad were surrounded by fire trying to save our 5 horses and 3 dogs. I kept telling them it does not matter if we lose our home as long as they get out safely. There was a moment when the little 2 acre clearing they were hunkering down in quite literally began combusting in flames, that I thought I lost my parents. I am so beyond grateful that they survived, along with all our animals. At the same time I’m experiencing so much grief, we have lost my childhood home. Everything on their property is gone, the cabins and barns that Mark built with so much love, their livelyhood, all of our family photos, everything. It is devastating.

"This week has been so hard.  It is just a lot for us.  Last Sunday, we had the assault, home invasion, & grand theft. 
Monday I was already set to take high schoolers from Neighborhood Church Chico to Elevate Camp at Lassen Pines.
Wednesday a fire started about a mile from my home in Chico.
Thursday winds changed,  smoke arrived at camp & our youth pastor Chris, myself, & some staff stayed up late getting info on the fire near our home & processing. 
Friday midday we made the decision to go home early (ps all 3 of us,  Chris, myself & Natalie, another Chico leader, separately sensed that we should go home early from camp) & processing what we & our community at home was feeling after less than 6 years ago our area was ravaged by the Camp Fire (deadly & devastating, which burned up to like a mile from our church where we had a huge shelter for 3 weeks where we served at almost constantly)  Yesterday evening, as we were leaving early from high school camp near Shingletown, that area went on Evacuation Warning AND Paradise & Magalia (area that burned in the Camp Fire) went on Evacuation Warning....heartbreaking for sure.  This morning, it is over 307,000 acres burned, and 0% containment in just 3 1/2 days. PRAY. PLEASE PRAY. The fire has 2 main columns that are twisting, & it is burning in 2 different directions.  This has been such a challenging week, & God has been so good as I process all this with Him.  I got home last night & slept there for the first time since the attack (which happened in our master bathroom & bedroom) We slept, not very good, but we were able to sleep, bad news there is still so much in the bedroom, we have to wash, clean & wipe down because it is covered in pepper spray.  For example,  I took one of medications last night, that was in my side table drawer, & my mouth was burning (the drawer was a little ajar &I had the cap off the medicine bottle)
 IT IS A LOT.  Pray for our community,  many of us with PTSD & Secondary PTSD. Pray that it stops.  Pray for full restoration for us mentally & financially (our Chevy Silverado,  Diamond Rings, Laptops & more haven't been found) Pray. #parkfire #Chico #buttecounty @kurt.wilkins.22",217855307.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C974pdPvGAk/,"Chico, California",2024-07-27 18:10:42

"As fires rage across the west, the reality is impossible to ignore. Smoke drifts from coast to coast, National Parks in the US and Canada burn. 

A PCT thru hiker contemplates his options as the air quality reaches hazardous levels. The Trail passes through the burn scar from the 2021 Dixie Fire, the largest in California history. He tells me he woke up in the middle of the night and kept hiking because he didn’t have cell service and couldn’t tell how close the new Park Fire was getting to his camp. 

Beachgoers at Lake Almanor ignore the reality. Are they making lemonade out of lemons or are they fiddling while Rome burns? 

Deer and birds at Lassen Volcanic National Park look all around as they seek fresh air where none is to be found. The Air Quality in the park reaches unmeasurable levels, maxing out our available measurement at 500. 

The light shifts from pleasant amber glow to sickening grey haze. We drive through a National Park but cannot see anything. A sign tells of a volcano directly in front of us, but all we can see is a wall of smoke. 

In the last two days, the fire has tripled in size. It is zero percent contained. I drive north and am relieved to see blue sky for the first time in a few days, but later that day the smoke settles into this valley, too, rendering everything in surreal layers and giving me a constant tickle in my throat. As with anything bigger than our comprehension, we shift the blame — arson, antiquated fire suppression techniques, an “unusually warm summer.” All are factors, none are to any more or less culpable than we are. But what do we do? I drive for hours and hours, mid-day turned to night, old burn scars as far as the eye can see. What can I do?",255700994.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C97_7e4yqah/,California,2024-07-27 19:14:20
"Update for Saturday 12:30PM: The fire is now 350,000 acres and still zero containment. The line at Rt 32 near my house seems to remain in place. Tomorrow, and after, the winds are forecast to turn the fire more toward the east, but a local friend who says she has heard from a firefighter on the ground says that he thinks our side of the road will stay ok. I have also been told that they did a back burn there so that's how they've managed to hold that boundary up to this point. My fear is floating embers with wind change. Still afraid to hope too much with the winds changing and the size of this disaster. Still no idea when we might be able to go back if we are able. Thanks for your continued support.

"I can’t express how grateful I am to each and every one of you who has rushed forward to help us during this devastating tragedy. Please know that everything you are doing to help us has not gone unnoticed and the overwhelming amount of love and support we have received during this time has brought me to tears more times than I can count. We have been working tirelessly to ensure the safety of our animal and placing them with new families. Our immediate priority is finding permanent homes for most of the reptiles that we still have and temporary foster homes for those still needing to be placed. If you have room and equipment to take in a foster (or multiple) please send me a message with the type of reptile you can accommodate and how many. Over the next couple of days I will begin photographing all remaining animals that need to find homes and posting them on my website. They will be heavily discounted to help move them quickly but ALL OFFERS will be considered with proof of proper husbandry as the priority is finding them a stable forever home. I still have so many messages to go through so please be patient with me as I navigate through this and I will get back to everyone as soon as I can. To say that my mind is scrambled at this time is truly an understatement. Thank you all once again for all your help and look out for the post when I notify that all remaining animals have been added to the website. If you would like to help our cause in other ways, please consider donating to our GoFundMe https://gofund.me/e8c0a5f4 or our Venmo: Nallely-Orozco #ParkFire #ParkFireVictim #FireVictim #KillerClutches",356644008325643.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C98PCCWyr1U/,Killer Clutches,2024-07-27 21:26:18
"#mentalhealthmatters @bcpublichealth ::: Our County has been through more than our fair share of disasters, and this is not a place any of us wanted to find ourselves again. We know that looking up at a sky filled with smoke affects this community. The fact that this has evacuated people who have been evacuated many times before is horrific.
 
Please do not hesitate to reach out to the Butte County Behavioral Health Access Line if you need assistance. They will do their best to direct you to appropriate resources and assist where they can.
 
We wish the best for all those affected by this disaster and thank our emergency personnel, volunteer organizations, and community, and County staff. We are not unfamiliar with times such as these where the community must come together.

"Mile 1,502: The sky was a violent shade of orange. I couldn’t see more than twenty feet ahead of me. Ash rained on my shoulders as I walked hesitantly northwards. Blackened husks of trees reached burnt fingers into the smoke-choked sky. Plumes of smoke bellowed from the mountain behind me, curling into endless spirals and thick clots of ash. The sun blazed an angry crimson through the dark clouds, illuminating the lighter parts with a strange orange hue. It was hauntingly beautiful in the most terrifying way. 

It felt like the end of the world. It was in a way — it was the end of my linear thru-hike. It was the end of thousands of miles of forest and precious ecosystems. It was end of people’s homes and lives as they knew it. My thru-hike was the smallest part of it. It was devastating to watch. And all because some guy pushed a burning car off the highway. Such an ignorant act lead to thousands of miles of destruction. 

If I learned anything from this experience, it’s that when life sets your future plans on fire, it’s time to get moving. The longer you wait around for things to get better on their own, the more smoke settles in. The more you start to get depressed about the trail that could’ve been. Dreams burn, plans change, life keeps moving. I might even do the Oregon Crest Trail instead of Oregon — who knows! Flexibility is the key to a fun thru hike. Sure, I skipped up 160 miles from Chester to Shasta — but no summer spent outside is time wasted. My goal now is to just hike 2,000 miles of the PCT — and if that’s not possible, then 2,000 cumulative miles of whatever trails sound fun. It’s time to keep moving ️

"️ Mill Creek at Lassen - A Moment in Time 

This painting captures the serene beauty of Mill Creek, just below Lassen, as painted on the new moon of this cycle last year. Tonight, this cherished area, including Mill Creek Resort, faces the threat of the ongoing park fire. May they hold the Hwy 32 fire line, and may this season of transformation be alchemized, returning to carbon for fresh creation and renewal.

This artwork is a tribute to nature’s resilience and the ever-changing landscapes we hold dear. Your thoughts and support for those affected by the fires are deeply appreciated.

 Stay safe, stay strong.

"Park Fire / Day 3 / July 26th

On the third day after an arsonist allegedly started the blaze by lighting his car aflame and pushing it down a hill, the Park fire grew to over 240,000 acres across Butte and Tehama counties. @calfire and assisting crews from across the state worked to keep the flames from jumping south / south-east of Highway 32. The fire spread North and jumped Highway 36 after nightfall, impacting communities along the route.

"Lassen Volcanic National Park has been closed due to the encroaching #ParkFire, which is threatening the park’s western edge. This closure comes three years after the Dixie Fire devastated much of the park’s eastern portion (pictured here).

All visitors have been evacuated from campgrounds, and reservations have been canceled. Park employees have also been evacuated from park housing and local homes, with most staying in hotels.

Fire officials warn that the fire could potentially reach both Manzanita Lake and Mineral Headquarters, areas that were not affected by the Dixie Fire.

"Long term plans dictate short term decisions. I’m having to constantly remind myself of that as I hesitantly uproot large parts of my life. See, my long term goal is to live abroad for at least a few years, nomadically photographing my way across this beautiful earth. I want to experience a multitude of different cultures firsthand. I want to taste their food, listen to their music, hear their stories and observe how they navigate the world. I honestly cannot think of a more enriching and educational experience than that. And photographing the journey would be a literal dream come true for me. Just the thought of it makes me clench my fists and shake with excitement. That is the long term goal that is directing my short term decisions. 

In the short term, however, before I fully launch into nomad mode, I’m choosing to bide my time, as there are family things that I want to remain present for, and an aging dog to consider. So for now I’m entering a phase of transition—a holding pattern, of sorts—one that I expect will make my eventual full launch even smoother and easier. 

Unless the #ParkFire screws this up, for the next 6-12 months I’ll be living near Mount Lassen, in Northern California, in a simple little cabin with a strong internet connection, surrounded by flowing creeks, lakes, meadows and wildlife. With tons of hiking and mountain biking trails to explore and a beautiful National Park just a short drive away. And while I will have plenty to keep me busy in the area, the cabin will also act as a homebase from which to launch road trips into other parts of Northern California and undoubtedly up into Oregon and Washington and likely many other states as well. 

Even this short term plan will be a big life change, and I expect it will have plenty of challenges, but my hope is that it ends up being an incredibly profound chapter in my life, a simpler chapter in my life, one that pushes me to a deeper and more fundamental understanding of myself, of nature and of the world I live in. And one that prepares me for the even bigger chapter to follow.",215567918.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C9-Hyr1pULh/,"Kathmandu, Nepal",2024-07-28 15:01:31

"Park Fire Victim: Meet Penny the Great Pyrenees 

I'm sure if you've been watching the news you've heard of the Park Fire raging across Northern CA. It's currently over 353,000 acres and still going. 

One family completely lost their home and have nowhere for their beloved Penny to go. They are asking if anyone could open their home temporarily for this beautiful girl until they figure out their living situation. 

About Penny: 

6 years old
About 80 lbs
Fixed 
Behind on her shots.
Microchipped.
Great with kids.
NOT good with cats.
House trained.
Leash trained.
Excellent and fierce chicken protector but not formally trained for that. 

With proper introductions she could possibly do well with other dogs but she's not well socialised (she's been a hill dog and only knows 2 other dogs) 

The only health issue she's had is chronic ear infections that they've seen a vet for and only got under control when they took poultry out of her diet. Now She eats diamond lamb and rice and no more ear infections. She will have food donated with her and will be provided for her length of stay.

If you can help please text 760-215-1679.

The entire park is closed including the entrance near Manzanita Lake. This place is magical. Miracles are needed to stop and contain this firestorm from all the small towns and natural wonders we love so much. Safety and prayers to the first responders, and all in its path.

"PCT - Near Old Station, California, mile 1374.

At 3:00, the sky turned Halloween orange.  It was already dusk. I was caught in the wake of the Park Fire, which had only begun a couple of days before, and had grown to over 200,000 acres.  It was 100 miles away.

I thought of how a good rain would fix everything, then it started raining.  Ashes.  The remains of a primitive forest floated down from the sky like bread crumbs, coating my truck with powder.

I drove another 70 miles before the smoke cleared just past Mount Shasta, only to encounter more smoke from the fires in Oregon. 

I got out of Dodge and headed for the coast.

"Update, 10:15AM Sunday: The big news of the day was a surprise automated call just before 10 that power had been restored to my property. I can only see that as a very positive and hopeful sign. While I know from various heat mapping sources that the fire nearest my place is mostly not active and burned out, with the active edge mostly driving farther north, there is a particularly problematic set of flames that is still burning actively and spreading across Rt 32 just to the north. You can see those spots on this map, which shows satellite hot spots and active flames as orange circles imposed over the right edge of the burn zone and Rt 32. With shifting winds this morning this area could easily wrap back down on my side of 32, which is uphill from the flames and therefore very easy to allow for spread. So I am still hopeful and still scared to be hopeful. That hasn't changed. I've booked 2 more nights at the motel in Fort Bragg since I do not know when the road will open and any evacuation order will be lifted, despite the power being back on. Thanks for your continued support.

"7.28.24 UPDATE #ParkFire
How is containment determined ?.. The Park Fire is 12% Contained and 353,194 acres as of 7:46 AM on Sunday, 7/28/2024. Involved California Counties: Butte, Plumas, Shasta, Tehama.

Situation Summary
The fire is actively burning in heavy, receptive fuel beds. This allows the fire to expand rapidly. Warm, windy, and dry conditions will increase risk of extreme fire activity, similar to what the fire has done previously. There will be higher temperatures and lower humidities today.

The current acreage is 353,194 total.

Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System Program (FIRIS) aircraft is flying over the fire, mapping acreage which will allow for periodic acreage updates.

Threats to Highway and Major Roads: Portions of Highway 32, 99, and 36 and Cohasset Road. Highway 32, and Cohasset Road are currently closed and are impacting potential evacuation routes, and commuter traffic for people who work in surrounding communities. We ask that the public continues to be diligent and prepared.

Damage inspection teams continue to identify and verify structures that have been damaged or destroyed. The numbers of structures reported are expected to adjust as the team verifies impacts.

"The Park Fire passed by my little town, within 16 miles between Friday and today. Pacific winds spared us, pinning the fire at the top of great Sacramento River Valley wall, pushing flames & smoke, east and north. Sorry to the citizens of Nevada who are getting the worst of our exhaust. 

I stand in complete awe of the immense power and force of nature. The terrible beauty of her sometimes destructive hand. (A hand, forced, by man). I’m grateful to our hardworking fire fighters who allow us to go on with our lives, knowing they’re covering our backs. I’m deeply sorry for all the people who lost their homes & the forest creatures who lost their lives. 

I will never forget the collision of so much devastation and loss, butting right up next to ordinary, life goes on, as usual…

California mountain people are pros at evacuating. Calm, orderly and early. Good job CalFire & TCSO  Tehama Alert  Thank you first responders & all the community helpers ❤️

"Thank you for all the notes of support and friends reaching out. I wanted to give some perspective of what the Park Fire did when it hit us . For the past six years, I have constructed various sprinkler arrays on the roof, on the fences and further out into the bushes on our east side, anticipating that that would be the worst case scenario for a fire. It acted pretty much how I thought it would. Things got pretty surreal, so I can’t pin how long it took. Just that it was massive, explosive and hot. We also had a fire pump on the pool with two inch and a half attack lines. We got very lucky in a number of ways that added up to us being able to pull this off .We also tried to save our neighbors house that caught fire but we’re unable to do so.

"In recent days, a large contingent of CAI staff were activated for the Park Fire - the largest wildfire currently burning in California. Assigned to base camps, our team of professionals actively engage with not only public safety personnel but also a variety of others from the community ranging from dignitaries to distraught fire victims, to unhoused individuals. 

This weekend one of our officers came in contact with an individual who wanted to end their life With the highest level of respect and professionalism, the officer was able to talk with the individual and get them the assistance they needed. 

Was it our job? No. Could they have told them to move along and disregard the person in a time of need? Sure. But they didn’t. Instead, they decided to show them what Cooke & Associates is all about - compassion, professionalism, and simply being a good human. A HUGE shout out to Mike and Don for their great work! We’re proud to have you both as all of our hard working group of professionals.

"Wildfires across the western United States and Canada put millions of people under air quality alerts on Sunday as thousands of firefighters battled the flames, including the largest wildfire in California this year.⁠
⁠
The Park Fire had scorched an area greater than the size of Los Angeles as of Sunday, darkening the sky with smoke and contributing poor air quality to a large swath of the northwestern U.S. and western Canada. The blaze spanned more than 562 square miles of inland Northern California.⁠
⁠
Firefighters were helped by cooler temperatures and more humidity on Saturday and made some progress, increasing containment from zero to 12%. The fire has drawn comparisons to the 2018 Camp Fire that tore through the nearby community of Paradise, killing 85 people and torching 11,000 homes.⁠

"Update, Monday, 10:45AM:  The line has held at Forest Ranch. There are still areas just north on Rt 32 that continue to flare and cause potential danger, so the evacuation orders there remain in place. The Sheriff suggested that we may be allowed back home in the next few days. My buildings and property appear to be intact. I am steeling myself for the drive back up my beautiful mountain now that it will be a post-apocalyptic hellscape. I am very grateful for your support in all ways, including the GoFundMe fundraiser to which some of you have contributed which has allowed me to stay in a motel far from the fire rather than in a shelter. Thank you so much. If I can get FEMA reimbursement for those expenses I will donate all of what I have received to families in need who have lost homes in this disaster.

"Heart shift. 
(And why I’m so grateful for you all) 

I’ll admit, It’s been heavy these past five days with the Park fire that started here in my hometown of Chico, California.

It has currently burned over 375,000 acres (as of today) and is not even 10 percent contained. 

It’s been touch and go, and how I can ground myself is being grateful…grateful for the firefighters, first responders, that no one has lost their lives…all of the people working together, and all the love. 

I want to thank everyone who has sent prayers too. 

It has added some light back in where literally the smoke has blocked the sun out!

What lights you up and makes the shift for you? 

I loved this quote when I saw it and thought about how much it makes people (and me) smile!

For me, it’s dresses with pockets!

Seeing people smile.
Beautiful connections.
People pulling together. 

No matter if it’s a dress with pockets, a text message from a loved one, or waking up and being grateful for this day, the things that we choose to be thankful for make the world a richer place.

A more connected space.

A more loving space. 

And for that, I am so damn grateful today. 

Please share what shifts your perspective and grounds you in turbulent times…. and brings you back to your center. 

Sending out so much love,

"My heart belongs to this land…. 
Our family is 99% sure we lost our cabin last night… my little bro is on the fire line fighting making it that much worse. Complete devastation is an understatement. My heart is broken for the land, the animals and destruction to the forest. The last bits of my mom and nanie burned away with cabin, with the swing my papa made for me the week he found out my mom was pregnant with me, with the chairs my grandfather cut out of giant fallen pine trees for me and my brother to sit around the fire, the Native American artifacts that connected us back to our ancestors my grandpa found up there and collected over his life, the mugs my nana used to make me hot chocolate in while they drank whiskey and laughed over cards, the chairs my grandfathers sat in getting ready to head out to go hunting before the sun comes up, the old radio that has been there for 35+ years that my papa would play “our” Marty robins song, the window we handed fire wood thru, and the land that forever has our hearts. None of this had to happen…… anyone and everyone being affected by this fire or any of these fires my heart hurts with you and my soul sees you. I’m sending love as that’s all I got left.

"Three hours & 10 miles later

Our last hike in Lassen Volcanic National Park began Thursday, July 25th, before sunrise. We trekked down to Bumpass Hell and witnessed the stunning sunrise seen here. Then, hiking up to the trail overlook, we spied what is now known as the Park Fire, near Chico, California, over 40 miles (65 kilometers) away. Down to the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitors Center, and a beautiful clear sky morphed before our eyes, completely smoke socked in within literally 10 minutes. Drove down the road 10 miles (~15 kilometers) and were engulfed in a bright orange fog. The fire has grown from less than 5,000 acres (2000 hectares) to over 360,000 acres (~150 000 hectares). Praying for a reduction in temperatures and wind, rise in humidity, and safe and successful fire suppression efforts by the forces at war with the fire.

We hiked, shot BB guns, went rock climbing, learned knife skills, and did our best to enjoy the camp food. It was his last year of cub scout camp, and while anxious to join the troop and continue his scouting journey, admits he will miss this place. 

The day after we left, camp staff and new campers were evacuated as they were threatened by the nearby #ParkFire. Nearly a week later, it’s affected nearly 375,000 acres and is still only 14% contained.

"My heart is sinking as I watch the reports of the Park Fire that currently threatens Lassen Volcanic National Park. It is now the 6th largest fire in California's history. 

Lassen is like a combination of Yosemite and Yellowstone, but without the crowds and therefore more pristine and truly peaceful. When I first visited the park several years ago, I was surrounded by dense forests that encompassed a geothermal area reminiscent of Yellowstone. 

However, during my last visit I witnessed the devastating effects of the 2021 Dixie Fire that consumed over 73,000 acres on the east side of the park, and almost a million acres overall. Now the west side is being threatened by the Park Fire, and the Loomis Museum is at risk of destruction.

The museum contains the photographs taken by Benjamin Loomis in the early 1900's of the Lassen area, including the volcanic eruption in 1914. Those photos gained the national spotlight and were used in the campaign to establish the Lassen Volcanic National Park. 

One of his photos is on this plaque next to a several-ton boulder that was thrown out of the crater during the eruption. According to Loomis, it was still hot to the touch three days later.

The Park Fire is only 14% contained at the time of this writing. Let's hope that the fire will be extinguished soon so that this incredibly beautiful, very special park will be spared.

" URGENT ⁠
The Park Fire has exploded to over 383,000 acres, making it one of California's largest wildfires. Last night, Chico Animal Shelter urgently asked us to take in all their adoptable pets to free up space for displaced animals.⁠
Our team is in Chico, loading up these cats and dogs to bring them to safety. While our shelter is already at capacity, when facing disaster, we must support our animal welfare community and be ready to help those who need it most. We will provide updates once we have safely returned to the shelter with the animals.⁠
Thank you for your support as we assist those affected by this devastating fire. ❤️⁠

"Paradise this morning. Park Fire smoke is sitting low on the mountain today. 

I can't speak for all of the Campfire survivors but for me the feeling I get in my body when I smell smoke is instantaneous fear. It sparks a deep seeded intensely strong panic the wells up in my throat. I get a little more on edge and have a hard time relaxing and sleeping. Worse of all it brings with it memories of the Campfire. 

I will never forget that day. Running for our lives, the utter devastation, and loss of life and our community. The aftermath of being homeless, having nothing, losing Bear and all the tragedy that came along with it.

 I struggle on days like this. I'm sure I'm not the only one. 

This is why it is so important that we have compassion with eathother. You never know what people are going through. Give hugs where hugs are needed. 

Huge thanks to everyone at #calfire for everything you do and have done to keep us all safe. You are all amazing and deserve to be honored like the selfless heros you are! 

Sending prayers to all the survivors of the #parkfire. Our thoughts and prayees are with you.

"CLIMATE EMERGENCY DAY:
The climate clock folks @climateclock.world invited our San Francisco Projection Dept. (SFPD)collective to project in the Bay Area on the global Climate Emergency Day of action--as North America faced unprecedented climate-charged heatwaves and wildfires. We said yes. Julie and I projected just after sunset by the Golden Gate Bridge, as the fog poured in from the Pacific Ocean. 

July 21, 2024 was declared Earth’s hottest day since records began. The next day the record was broken again--which also happens to be #ClimateEmergencyDay.

On July 22 2024, the Climate Clock ticks below five years, a key milestone for humanity that will spark a wave of synchronised actions in over 2 dozen countries, demanding an end to fossil fuels, and pushing leaders to #ActInTime to accelerate real climate solutions. On this day, we will officially have 4 YEARS to dramatically reduce fossil fuel emissions to stay below 1.5C degrees warming. 

CLIMATE FIRES: I'm trying to follow friends dealing with evacuations and toxic smoke around the Park Fire in Northern California. AP News writes, ""Communities elsewhere in the U.S. West and Canada are under siege from fast-moving flames. More than 110 active fires covering 2,800 square miles (July 28) were burning in the U.S. on Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. “Amped up” is how Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at Yale’s School of the Environment, described the recent fires. Marlon said, “The big message is that seeing extreme wildfires is just part of a series of unnatural disasters that we are going to continue seeing because of climate change,” she said.""

Climate chaos and climate justice solutions are woven into our other crisis--war/occupation, poverty/inequality, and ecological crisis. A global movement of fossil fuel resistance and climate solutions is actually doing what needs to be done, but needs all of us to throw down to scale up bigger and faster. 

The clock is ticking.

"Managed to get to the Pacific coast today...Half Moon Bay. A fortunate occasion and suggestion from my sister we visited. Had lunch, took a walk, and even let the puppy-girls get their paws wet. Admittedly, as a native Arizonan and inlander, I'm not a big fan of the ocean, but have always appreciated the diverse terrain, vegetation, beaches, and weather the coast offers. Good day! 

On the road to Reno tomorrow to visit friends. Unfortunately, his hands are way full in dealing with the #parkfire right now.

@greenpeace posting about Northern California  Thank you✌

The #ParkFire is now the fifth largest in recorded #California history. 

Images of the destruction are heartbreaking 

All around the world, devastating fires are made worse by extreme heat , which is being fueled by big oil corporations ⛽️

Big oil has known for decades that its profits endanger us all. 

Polluters leave it to everyday people to pick up the bill while paying NOTHING for the damages they cause

"The smoke from the wildfires moved into Lake Tahoe basin yesterday filling the sky with shades of red as the sun set. While the colors were a vibrant show, it was a grim reminder of what is happening close by. 

The Park fire ( Butte, Plumas, Shasta, Tehama county) continues to burn heavily and is only 18% contained at this time. It has grown to be 392,480 acres (611 square miles) making it one of Californias largest fires in history. 

My heart go out to all the residents of these counties. We know this area is not only beautiful, but it’s home. 

We are so thankful for the constant effort by firefighters and other service members to contain not only this fire, but many burning around the area as well. Your courage is unparalleled. ❤️

Fire season is a strange season. We are hoping this is the peak of it.

"Update: Thursday, 12PM: I'd like to get back to my normally scheduled programming here, but I'm grateful for all of the inquiries about my well-being and this is the easiest way for me to reach the most people with information. Here in Forest Ranch, the main issues since returning Tuesday evening have been around air quality. The first slide above is yesterday's AQI, which is the worst I've ever seen it anywhere I have been in CA. The 2nd is today through Monday's forecast. This is a significant positive change from the original forecast which predicted today to be the worst day. I have neighbors who have chosen to evacuate again today because the winds have turned to be out of the WSW, and they are blowing the odor of ash and extinguished fire coals through here. It's not active smoke so much as the smell of an extinguished fire, which is more sickening to my nose but the AQI suggests it's not a major health risk and I have no respiratory issues.

This wind change definitely puts my area more at risk of a flare up and more burning, so that's not good, but the active flames are mostly miles north of me now. One neighbor has been riding his pit bike down to the fire line and has had to get firefighters on spots that have started to become active again, so sleeping and feeling safe is just not something we can do yet. That line is about 1500' from my property.

The winds will continue to be a directional threat to my home for the foreseeable forecast, with temps rising and humidity decreasing. The one positive aspect is that those winds are only low velocity (see 3rd slide).

That's about all I can report for now. The stress and tension remains very high, and will do so for weeks as this plays out. I also need to buy some expensive water test kits and send them out each week to ensure that my well water remains drinkable and safe. Thank you to my donors for helping me to afford those as well. Thank you for your concern. On a side note, I've lost about 15 followers due to these posts. Good riddance to those horrible people. I'm not here for followers, I'm here for real people and I thank you for being real people.

"Like many, I’ve been grappling with the recent fires, in my own way. Though I’m now a few hundred miles north of my hometown, Paradise, the sense of disruption and chaos remains palpable. I feel deeply for the hundreds of families displaced, for those who have lost their homes, and for the futures they believed were secure. I wish I had words of comfort, resources, or answers to offer. Instead, I am confronted with the grief and sorrow that follow such profound disruption.
In a moment meant for offering hope, I found myself drawn to express my frustration and anxiety. What follows is a poem that captures these emotions, reflecting the turmoil within and the collective pain we endure.

"California is seeing “the first of several days where fire weather will become increasingly critical,” @calfire said on Thursday, as the ongoing Park Fire – one of the largest in state history – continues to grow.

Now nearing 400,000 acres burned, Northern California is bracing for temperatures that will reach triple digits in the coming days as the fire fuels continue to feed its flames.

"My brother and his wife had to evacuate the day that the Park Fire started in Chico, Ca., by an idiot who lit a car on fire and shoved it over the embankment in Bidwell Park. My brother’s neighborhood, which sits along a creek, was on all the news, as there were 6 homes that burned, one of which belonged to a retired fire captain, who was out of town that night, helping out on another fire. My brother’s house, fortunately, survived, but the fire burned right up to their lawn 12 feet from their house, and burned all around their house. The last 4 photos show before the fire and after the fire, in their backyard. The first 6 photos are of their neighbors homes that didn’t survive. It’s sickening, all because of some idiot. Thank you to all the firefighters for your hard work!

"STRIKE TEAM UPDATE

California has already seen an extremely high volume of wildfires early in to this fire season. The South San Joaquin County Fire Authority currently has nine personnel and apparatus assigned to the Park Fire in Northern California. Our strike teams are deployed knowing they may serve up to fourteen days before our crews are swapped out. 

Retired Battalion Chief, Scott Arganbright was deployed to the Park Fire on July 20th as a Strike Team leader. Our first crew was deployed on July 24th with our Office of Emergency Services (OES) Type 3 Engine (OES 4307); and our second crew was deployed on July 27th with our OES Type 1 (OES 349) . Each of these crews consist of a Captain, an Engineer and two firefighters. Replacement crews are prepared and ready to report on August 8th if necessary. 

SSJCFA has maintained daily staffing within our organization and service delivery to our community has not been affected or reduced throughout our state assistance. 

The Park Fire has had erratic fire behavior and even a fire tornado. Within the first two days, OES 4307 personnel performed an aggressive fire attack and successfully saved a home. Our crews are working hard and check in regularly to let us know they are doing well (when cell service allows). 

South San Joaquin County Fire Authority is proud to serve our local community as well as the residents of California.

"Update on this weekends event: Over winter, while tackling the tedious endeavor of sifting through an attic brimming with decades of Lakeshore’s memories, we came across a stash of luau decor. Our hearts swelled with obvious nostalgia after unrolling a banner that read “14th Annual Lakeshore Luau”. Running a vacation destination can be a very thankless job some days, especially a place that needs so many improvements. Choices had to be made; compromises struck in areas where improvements beckoned. But we do what we can when we can and try to prioritize overall experience. That’s why our family knew the annual luau was something we needed to revive this summer at Lakeshore. 

We hope that using this weekend as an opportunity to help the communities and individuals around us who are affected by the fires will help kick off this annual tradition in a positive way. 

Please share and invite your friends and family to be a part of this start of a new tradition lakeside.

"California’s Park Fire started on 7/24/24 and has destroyed 394,953 acres across four counties (Butte, Plumas, Shasta, Tehama). As of August 1 at 7:36 pm, only 22% of the fire has been contained. Resources assigned include 6,305 personnel, 537 engines, and 41 helicopters. 

One of those helicopters flew into a remote area that had been evacuated to try and rescue four Rottweiler puppies and their mother and father. They had been left behind when their owner’s truck broke down on the side of the road while they were all trying to evacuate. The truck’s owner was not able to take the dogs, but provided the location of the vehicle to the Sheriff’s Office. Because of the fire, rescuers could not immediately get to the dogs’ location.

On Saturday, days after the dogs were left behind, Trevor Skaggs, a member of the sheriff’s search-and-rescue team, flew to the area in a helicopter to find the dogs. After landing, Skaggs ran more than a mile to the location where the dogs were reported to be. He found the adult male Rottweiler dead, but the mother and puppies were alive in the truck, tired and very thirsty. Skaggs gave them all water and fed them a few bites of his granola bar, and sang to them. He managed to coax the pups and their mother to follow him back to the helicopter, more than a mile away. Video of dogs following Skaggs in comments below.

The dogs are currently being cared for by the North Valley Animal Disaster Group.

آتش‌سوزی گسترده پارک در کالیفرنیا صدها خانواده را مجبور به ترک خانه‌هایشان و همراه آوردن حیوانات خانگی‌شان کرده است. با افزایش تعداد حیوانات بی‌خانمان، پناهگاه‌های حیوانات با ظرفیت محدود روبرو شده‌اند و برای اسکان همه این حیوانات با چالش مواجه شده‌اند.

به دنبال درخواست کمک از یک پناهگاه حیوانات در چیکو، سازمان بشردوستانه برکلی اعلام آمادگی کرد تا به چندین ده حیوان آسیب‌دیده از این آتش‌سوزی پناه دهد. با این حال، این سازمان نیز با ظرفیت کامل مواجه بود، اما به دلیل اهمیت موضوع، تصمیم گرفت تا به حیوانات بی‌خانمان کمک کند.

در این راستا، سازمان بشردوستانه برکلی با استفاده از واحد پذیرش سیار خود، ۲۵ گربه و ۱۰ سگ را از منطقه آتش‌سوزی به پناهگاه خود منتقل کرد.

آتش‌سوزی پارک که به دلیل آتش‌زدن عمدی آغاز شده است، به پنجمین آتش‌سوزی بزرگ در تاریخ کالیفرنیا تبدیل شده و مناطق وسیعی از چندین شهرستان را تحت تأثیر قرار داده است.

کارکنان پناهگاه‌ها اعلام کردند که در روزهای آینده اطلاعات مربوط به حیوانات جدید را در وب‌سایت خود قرار خواهند داد.

"National Park #44: Lassen Volcanic National Park. I have now seen all 9 NPs of California. This was an interesting ride. We had planned to camp there 2 nights and hike to the top of Mt Lassen with some other hikes. Mother Nature had other plans. The day we flew in to Sacramento, we saw a little brush fire on the side of interstate 5. By the next morning, this had become the Park Fire, the 5th largest fire in California history. We drove up to the park because at that time we weren't sure what was going on. At the visitors center, Ash fell onto our car and our clothes. We talked to the park ranger and were told hiking in this smoke would be equivalent to smoking 5 packs of cigarettes. They were on pre-evacuation. We decided to drive through the park, cancel our reservation for camping and wing it. Ended up west in California near the trinity shasta forest. The national park completely closed the next day and while the fire hasn't hit it yet, it's very close. 

I hope someday I can go back to Lassen because I think it could be a hidden gem! Also of note, this fire was caused by a human who pushed his mom's burning car over the side of a ravine. He is in prison.

"The last few days at the cabin got pretty smokey. The Park Fire, which started July 24 at Upper Bidwell Park, has burned at least 399,437 acres and is only 24% contained. The Park Fire is the 4th largest fire in California history, largest fire this year, and was intentionally set by a man who pushed his car, that was on fire, into a ravine. Currently CAL FIRE and Incident Management Teams have deployed over 6,300 personnel assigned to the fire. That includes more than 40 helicopters, 500 engines, 180 dozers, 140 water tenders, and 120 handcrews. Some people who lost their homes in the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise have lost their homes for the second time now. Growing up in California, I don't remember there ever being fires like this, and now it's happening every summer at a devastating level. But global warming definitely isn't a thing, right? Lol. I hope they're able to find a way to contain this fire soon

"NOTE: The Strike Team leader wanted to specifically mention the fact that this homeowner had excellent defensible space that you can easily see from the photos. There was no clutter around the house, the grass was mowed, and the home was easy to defend from fire. Great job Scott!

Six years ago, Scott Lotter lost his home in Paradise to the #CampFire. Since then, he rebuilt his new dream home in Richardson Springs, Butte County.

On the first night of the #ParkFire, it was flashbacks to that awful event in November 2018.

Lotter's neighborhood was evacuated, but as fire raced towards his home, fortunately Strike Team 9170C was nearby.

Firefighters from CAL FIRE CZU and @calfire_scu aggressively protected the neighborhood.

Lotter's security camera caught CZU Engine 1761 working to save his new home.

Firefighters followed the direction of the fire and positioned engines around homes that were in the path of oncoming fire.

They dug control line around homes, put out spot fires, and put themselves where they needed to be to have the biggest impact.

It is devastating that so many have lost their homes to wildland fires, but we must recognize that so many more have been saved thanks to the hard work of firefighters from all over the state and even beyond. 

Lotter is grateful his home is still there, and he's got a special connection to the fire service. His son-in-law is a Fire Captain in @calfirelnu!

As we enter the warmest months of the year and the typical time for peak fire activity in the state, we can all do our part to practice fire-safety-starting with great defensible space!

Special thanks to the entire Strike Team, and to Engine 1761 including FC Sean Davis, FF Francis Campion, and FF Adrian Weidner.",415895016.0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C-L_I4GyZWX/,Butte County,2024-08-03 00:15:16

"The heavy smoke has been terrible today I use https://fire.airnow.gov/ and https://outlooks.airfire.org/ for updates on the air quality in the North State. 

According to the website, https://outlooks.airfire.org/ , our highest air quality value in Chico, CA will be 268 at 9:00pm tonight. This is very unhealthy and almost hazardous air quality due to the smoke from the Park Fire

“Heavier smoke impacts this morning due to the increased fire activity early evening. South winds will push smoke directly North impacting Shingletown, McArthur and Mt. Shasta. These communities can expect air quality in the Unhealthy to Very Unhealthy, with hours of Hazardous possible, throughout the day and into the night. Communities to the East and West will see mostly Moderate to Good air quality throughout the day.” - https://outlooks.airfire.org

Everyone should try to avoid outdoor physical activity as much as possible throughout the next couple of days. ‍♀️ Stay safe everyone and try to do things that keep your mind at ease. @calfire_butteco and all other frontline workers are working hard to keep us safe.

"The Park Fire is now the 4th largest wildfire in California's history and is still burning. It has scorched hundreds of thousands of acres and destroyed hundreds of homes. All this, right next door to Paradise, which killed 85 people in 2018's Camp Fire. Many people still traumatized from that tragedy are now experiencing the devastation all over again. 

I have been covering the Park Fire from the start and had the opportunity to go live for (in addition to Sacramento of course) CBS Bay Area, CBS Los Angeles, and CBS 24/7 Streaming National News. Scroll to the end to take a look. It's the most meaningful reporting I've done in my career thus far.

"I love volcanoes. I love the unique landscapes they create. Hawaii is what made me fall in love with them, but clearly this isn’t Hawaii. We visited our 34th National Park — Lassen Volcanic just a day after the Park Fire started in Chico, CA. Smoke from this fire blew into the park and created some beautiful but eerie scenes within the park. Sadly we didn’t get to hike any of the trails because the smoke was so thick, being outside just 10-15 minutes definitely affected our throats and the interior of our car even had a faint campfire smell to it even just from quickly opening the doors! We went around sunset and love the look of the orange skies  Just over a day after we were there, the park was shut down and evacuated because of the fire approaching. As of when I’m posting this, the fire hasn’t reached the park yet, and I’m hoping that it doesn’t since much of the park was burned just a couple of years ago from the Dixie Fire

"There's a 360 panorama video of the vast landscape surrounding @ywamchico , wherein the majority has evidence of being ravaged by fire.

There's one relatively small area that is still vibrant and untouched.

The fire literally encircled the campus, and was barred from destroying it.

You could say that it's luck or coincidence; what I can tell you definitively is there were prayers covering this campus on a global level beginning with the evacuation.

I can also tell you that God has worked in beautiful, important ways in this valley, and it wouldn't shock me that He might want to protect it.

For many of us, images like this are simply confirmation of the amazing truth we know about the God who Protects.

Prayers are still needed, particularly for funding to address smoke damage and impacts on elements of infrastructure,  but what a powerful testament God has given this team of full-time volunteers to equip them for this next -- unexpected -- season.

"SOS CALIFORNIA .

California lleva 12 días ardiendo en llamas, enfrentándose al cuarto incendio más grande en su historia que ha arrasado con más de 300.000 hectáreas de bosque, y que ha dejado a miles de personas sin un hogar. Es importante que hablemos del tema que demos visibilidad y que tomemos conciencia de que son millones de hectáreas de bosque que estamos perdiendo anualmente, estamos acabando con los recursos naturales del planeta, estamos dando pie a una extinción  masiva de especies, y la propia de nosotros como seres humanos. ES NUESTRO PLANETA EL QUE SE ESTA QUEMANDO!!!! Me duele ver como todo simplemente se reduce a cenizas  y pasamos de ver paisajes verdes a simplemente ver montañas y  nubes negras llenas de contaminación  que van directamente para nuestra atmósfera y que incrementan los efectos del cambio climático en él mundo.

Hablemos de biodiverdiad, hablemos de naturaleza, empecemos a hablar de estos temas, a darles visibilidad, a priorizar esto por encima de cualquier otra cosa, por que llegará el momento en el que todos tomemos conciencia y reflexionemos pero va a ser muy tarde. 

S.O.S CALIFORNIA

"On July 24, a flaming car pushed into a gully in Bidwell Park ignited the Park fire, the fourth-biggest fire in state history, which has consumed more than 620 square miles in Northern California. This and other similar events, underscore that most of California's wildfires are human-caused.

Thanks to our @petcolove Disaster Response grant, we were able to purchase cardboard carriers for all of the families that needed a safe way to transport their cats home, plus a few extra to add to our cat emergency shelter box.

"Dear monca members, friends and community,

The ever-growing Park Fire has devastated an area we hold dear as well as the homes of many of our members and museum visitors. We want you to know we’re ready to help in any way that’s needed, and maybe one not in your current train of thoughts. 

For the past year, the museum has been offering various ways to use art as a health and healing avenue. Our high quality Northern California art exhibitions offer visitors the opportunity to relax, be introspective and quiet for the time they’re at the museum. The small art library is consistently used by both adults and children to read, talk and type on the old typewriter! 

Through bellydance for all bodies, tea blending, Foot Foundation classes and card making, we’ve reached out to those in need using the arts as a calming space for their restless minds. 

Music becomes a soothing medium during concerts and when people sit down to play our beautiful piano.

Please know we’re all thinking of you and eager to help you find a place of solace and recovery. We’re here to offer a listening ear, a hug or just a place to rest and feel welcome.

With gratitude,

Pat Macias, Executive Director

When combined with extremely low humidity, it caused the fire in Mill Creek to flare up in a big way.

Park Fire briefing today 8.6.24  at Tehama County Incident Command. The fire is making a run through the Mill Creek drainage with weather conditions in single digit humidity and over 100 degrees. Direct firefighting in the drainage is difficult and resources have been pulled back from the area due to the fire activity. 

Contingency lines have been established on both sides of the drainage that will be monitored as firefighters work through this weather event. Conditions are forecasted to cool off again in two days and we are expecting to have a direct attack on the fire line again.

Cascades, USA

夏休みの家族旅行から
シャスタ山に帰ってきました！

そのシェアの前に、
シアトルからサクラメントまでのフライトからの絶景
カスケード山脈！の感動をシェア

カナダからシャスタ山を含む、南北に西海岸を連なる
見事なカスケード山脈、火山帯です

マウントレーニア
マウントフッド
シスターズ
そしてラッセン

私のシートは左側だったため
残席ながらシャスタ山は右側のため見下ろせず
それでも大満足
まるでツアーに参加しているようでした

そしてまた
新たに訪れたい大自然に出会えました
ワシントン州オレゴン州の国立公園
アメリカの大自然、深いです

リトリートのお客様で
シアトルーメッドフォード便ご利用の方、
シャスタ山は見えませんが、ぜひ景色を！

また私たちが不在中に始まった山火事
#parkfire
シャスタから3時間南のチコで　
まだ火災は続いているようです…

ありがたいことに
シャスタ山は風向きによっては
噴煙が飛んでくることがあったようですが

今日も青空
暑いですがきれいに晴れています

今日は32度
来週は24度まで涼しくなるようです

昨日はもうすでに秋空の雲
シャスタ山も夏山の色姿です

8月にリトリートでお会いする皆様
またシャスタ山の美しい自然を巡ること
楽しみにしております

"Urgent Plea for Fosters: Help Us Save Lives Amidst the Park Fire Crisis
The devastating Park Fire has overwhelmed local shelters, leaving countless dogs without a safe place to go. Our shelter is ready to step up and bring these vulnerable dogs into our care—but we can’t do it alone. We need as many of our current dogs in foster as possible by 12:00pm TOMORROW 8/9!
Right now, we need to make room by finding temporary homes for the dogs currently in our shelter. By fostering, even for a short time, you can provide a safe and loving space for these dogs, and in doing so, you’ll allow us to rescue more dogs who are in immediate danger.

"Fires are very much a returning threat in the American Northwest, with the #ParkFire measuring up to be the fourth largest wildfire in California history.*

Having first ignited on July 24, the still burning Park Fire has spread to Butte, Tehama, Shasta, and Plumas Counties. While there are no known fatalities, the blaze has completely destroyed 636 buildings to date (including residential and commercial properties) and damaged another 49. It is not yet known how soon the fire will be contained.

In response, #TzuChiNorthwest, in collaboration with #TzuChiChico, sent a small team to conduct disaster assessments in Cohasset in Butte County, CA on August 1. This was followed by disaster relief registration days from August 5-6 at the Butte County Local Assistance Center (LAC) in Chico, CA, with more than 100 households registering for assistance from Tzu Chi USA.

Among those who shared their stories were Kristy Daneau and Julia White Sanchez.

Kristy had been a recipient of #TzuChiUSA’s disaster relief care back in the deadly Camp Fire in 2018. Restarting her life from scratch, Kristy found herself back at square one. Seeing Tzu Chi was back to provide help after the Park Fire this time around, she told Tzu Chi volunteers about the eco-blanket she had received from them in 2018: “I still remember the blankets were made of plastic bottles; they were so soft & helped me get through the cold winters for a few years.”

Julia, too, experienced loss through the CZU Lightning Complex Fire in 2020, another wildfire in 2023, but also landslides caused by heavy rains last year. But being our former care recipient, too, Julia expressed positivity: “seeing #TzuChiVolunteers made me feel that everything was going to be okay.”

Despite the great pain Park Fire survivors have endured, we remain steadfast and committed to being by their side as they recover from this tremendous disaster.

"Tzu Chi brinda esperanza en medio del incendio de Park, registrado como el cuarto más grande en California por @calfire ❤️‍

El devastador #ParkFire, que se inició el 24 de julio, continúa propagándose rápidamente por los condados de Butte, Tehama, Shasta y Plumas. Las llamas han dejado un rastro de destrucción, consumiendo completamente 636 estructuras y dañando otras 49. Aunque afortunadamente no se reportan víctimas mortales, la magnitud del incendio y su rápida expansión mantienen a las autoridades en alerta máxima.
El incendio de Park en California ha dejado a muchas familias sin hogar. Sin embargo, la compasión de Tzu Chi brilla en medio de la tragedia. Los voluntarios de #TzuChiNorthwest y #TzuChiChico llegaron el 1 de agosto a Cohasset en #Butte, CA para evaluar los daños. Seguido de esto los días 5 y 6 de agosto, en el Centro de Asistencia Local (LAC) del condado de Butte, en Chico (California), se registraron más de 100 hogares para recibir ayuda de #TzuChiUSA. 
La presencia de Tzu Chi brinda consuelo y esperanza a quienes lo han perdido todo. Al proporcionar alimentos, ropa, mantas y asistencia emocional, los voluntarios ayudan a las comunidades a reconstruir sus vidas.
La historia de Tzu Chi en esta región se remonta al incendio de Camp Fire, donde la organización también brindó ayuda crucial. Con cada nuevo desastre, Tzu Chi demuestra su compromiso con ayudar a las personas en momentos de necesidad.

"Over the past few weeks, it’s been a waiting game for @lassennps. The #ParkFire, started by human action, has been ravishing northern central California, destroying structures, threatening lives, and now is threatening public land. Today, hopefully, it looks as if the fire has been stopped. (See my buddy @cliftonwanders for a much more comprehensive understanding of how these fires work and are dealt with.) Even if the fire has been stopped, this is sort of an uneasy peace for the region. Climate change has rendered the landscape a tinderbox. Anything out of the ordinary can spark another fire. All it takes is that and some wind and one of the most special and beautiful landscapes in the world could literally go up in smoke. That’s already happened. In 2021, the #DixieFire imposed far ranging damage on the park and left a lasting burn scar which has since recovered, somewhat. Fire is a natural part of the landscape, after all. But this? Massive blazes caused by human action and exacerbated by climate change? No. This threatens the delicate and beautiful ecosystem of Lassen and that’s heartbreaking. I can’t imagine, I don’t want to imagine Lassen’s graceful meadows, and wildflowers, and streams covered in flame and ash. I’ve only been once and I want to return to drink in more of its sublime mountain glory. I really hope that that’s a possibility in the future and that the Park Fire is taken care of. Even more so than that, I maintain hope that we, collectively, begin the needed and vital work of fighting against climate change so that fires like this are rarer, more easily dealt with, and this climate emergency for the whole planet is a thing of the past.

"PCT California Section M (verkürzt wegen Park Fire) - Hwy 49 (Sierra City) -> Bucks Lake Rd, Meile 1197.5 - 1269 (Kilometer 1925,6 - 2042,2)

Der Aufstieg von Sierra City war lang und anstrengend - aber einen guten Hiker sieht man das auf Bildern natürlich nicht an 

Der Kontrast zwischen den Gletscherseen und Schluchten des Feather Rivers war sehr beeindruckend und abwechslungsreich. An den Bäumen hingen immer öfter Sprüche - ob die nun motivierend oder doch eher nervig sind, das entscheidet jeder für sich 

In dieser Sektion hatten wir beide Geburtstag (25.7. und 26.7.) und jeweils ein paar Kleinigkeiten für den anderen vorbereitet: Pepsi, Pies, andere Süßigkeiten und Videobotschaften von unseren Liebsten durften hier natürlich nicht fehlen, sowie ein ausgiebiger Wasseraufenthalt  

Und leider ist während dieser Sektion das Park Fire ausgebrochen  Somit mussten wir den PCT an der Bucks Lake Road verlassen und viele Meilen überspringen. Wir sind dann über Quincy nach Mt Shasta gehitched: 1 Tag und 4 Hitches und extrem viel Gastfreundschaft. 

Der letzte Hitch war 2 Autostunden lang und Maria und ihre Tochter sind nur unserer wegen nach Mt Shasta gefahren (und dann direkt wieder 2 Autostunden zurück!) - unglaublich!!!

"The Park Fire keeps burning, and is, as of today, 429,118 acres burned and is 36% contained. It started in Upper Bidwell Park in Chico and burned north and north east from there. It burned through Richardson Springs, Cohasset, half of Forest Ranch, and has moved up into Tehama Co in Lassen National Park. In all, it has affected Butte, Plumas, Shasta and Tehama Counties. 

The photos and vid in this post show how close it came to our client’s home that was in escrow and, has now sold. 

Our hearts and prayers go out to all of the people and families who have lost in this fire.

"My home has burned
My heart aches
My dance retreat space
My holidays with my mom, the girls GramaSu
The annual reunion I hosted with life long friends
The walks in the forest 
The lavender fields my mom grew from seed
The fire pit evenings gazing at the flame and gazing up at the stars
The dancing on the basketball court to various bands over the years
Playing bite the bag
Swinging from the huge swing hung from the large oak tree 
Swimming in the pond
Taking saunas at night and plunging into the cold water
The happy hour sun against the evergreen skyline
Our cottage my husband built
The swimming pool shenanigans
The star gazing in the field
Our wedding
My sisters wedding
My cousins wedding
My friends wedding
Thanksgiving
Christmas
Naked children running around because we could 
The hippies 
The dancers
The guests
The family
The friends 

ALL memories

I will miss what this place was so so so much, it hurts.

Hey there, I hope you’re doing well. Our family is in shock after the Park Fire in Cohasset completely destroyed our mom Susie Lawing’s home and everything on her property. We’re trying to raise funds to help her rebuild her life, and any donation or share of the link below would make a huge difference. Thank you so much!

"This past weekend, 35 #TzuChiNorthwest & #TzuChiChico volunteers came together to host their first round of disaster relief distributions for those impacted by the recent #ParkFire in California—providing a grand total of $61.4K in emergency financial assistance.

On Sat, 8/10, care recipients came to receive emergency financial assistance (or EFA) from #TzuChiUSA at the Local Assistance Center in Chico, CA, and then on Sun 8/11, at the @chiphousing office in Chico, CA. In total, 91 households benefited, and Tzu Chi volunteers provided 72 eco-blankets as well as 71 bamboo banks for families to have the opportunity to pay it forward.

In addition to this, our corps of caring and compassionate volunteers spent time with each family to learn more about their situation and offer emotional comfort as many of them opened up about the pain of losing their home and nearly all of their belongings.

Care recipients also received a letter of condolence written by Dharma Master Cheng Yen, which left few dry eyes among those who read it.

As families cope with their great loss, there is much left to do. Help us provide light, hope, and practical aid that helps disaster survivors move forward in their lives with a donation at https://donate.tzuchi.us/cause/sanjose

"Personal post: Just now able to return home after more than two weeks evacuated due to the Park Fire in Northern California. We're incredibly lucky that the house is still standing and are beyond grateful for that. It burned right up to the rose garden and clothesline on one side, burned nearly all of the fence along the perimeter of the property, and right up to a garden shed on the other side. All but one of the eight outbuildings burned, they contained my dad's epic and irreplaceable chainsaw collection, storage of some of our personal things (photos: vintage typewriter from my dad, a conch shell and other shells from my grandmother, holiday decorations, camping stuff, some of my dad's old books, an AC unit, tools and appliances, and more), well and pump house, more chainsaws, countries tools and equipment, and cords and cords of chopped and stacked firewood enough for about 10 winter seasons. But the house was saved. Trying to focus on the positive and what we still have instead of the loss. Several of our neighbors and friends lost their homes to this devastating fire.

Su is a tenacious being with a heart and spirit of Gold! ⭐️ Her way of accepting all that is, is inspiring to me! She is still thinking of ways to gather, rebuild, make food and have music up at her land once the clean up has happened!! 

- if you would like to donate to her gofundme I’ll have a link where you can do so!! She didn’t have insurance so she could use lots more help!

Seedlings pop up
Yet the trees have to be cut
Dead burned trees
The rains will come
The sun will shine
This place will not look the same in my moms life for sure 
This place will grow but be different in my lifetime
We do not have funds to build a house
We have funds
But not enough 
We will fundraise more
How and where?
When and what bands?
Where do we go from here?
I keep telling everyone who asks me, “I don’t know”
I don’t know 
I don’t have a vision for this place
The pragmatic headspace I live in makes me question of anything other than camping, trailers and yurts could work
Will we ever have a family home to return to for a holiday?
Will I ever be able to host my dance retreat?
Will my reunion with my favorite people have a house to do all our cooking and dancing in?
Will my mom be ok?

"It’s been a bit. 3 weeks ago I was part of a 3 man strike team to help relieve and support the brave men & women fighting the #parkfire that was caused by arson July 24 @ 1452hrs that affected Butte, Plumas, Tehama and Shasta counties. Over 429,603 acres burn and close to 700 structures destroyed or damaged totaling to almost $300 million in cost.

This was a first for me, since I’m a city firefighter, our wildland fires consist of flat terrain not hills or mountains and there’s not that much hiking on steep terrain, carrying over 40 lbs of equipment. It was a pleasure grouped with the LNU-Napa Cal-Fire guys. They answered any questions I had and even got to trained with them and cooked some delicious meals.

During down time, we worked out , played cards, monopoly and I even brought my basket and some putters to keep my putting on point. It’s been almost 2 months since I last played a tournament due to my torn miniscus, but seems like it’s getting better and can’t wait to get out and compete again⛓️

"The animation begins on July 25th, a day after the fire’s ignition amid windy, hot, and dry conditions.  Rapid spread occurred on July 26th, as the fire roared toward the northwest. The light brown gap visible on July 28 is part of the burned area, but the fire spread too fast through dry, grassy terrain. The#PARKFIRE on July 24, 2024 charred nearly 670 square miles of in Northern California. The fire is ranking the state’s 4th-largest fire on record.  As the long-duration event unfolded, instruments orbiting Earth collected a wealth of data. Optical images captured in July revealed the dramatic smoke plume & burned area after an early period of rapid growth.  The animation above shows the fire’s progression between July 25 & Aug 10th. Fire perimeter data are from the Fire Events Data Suite (FEDS), which identify the hot spots of active fire during the day & night.  A second run kicked off toward the northeast around Aug 6, and by August 10, FEDS data indicate that the fire affected 628 square miles.

The pool was built in the early 70’s after we moved here when I was two years old. The amount of times we swam, did back flips off the diving board, sun bathed, played Marco Polo, dodged Herman the pool sweeper, swam on hot summer days until the sun set, and yes even skateboarded in it when it was empty…

I can’t even tell you how many times. 

How many people who were fortunate enough to enjoy this sweet pool, with its original rocks around the edge that came from the near by creek in Cohasset? 

I don’t know if I could count. 

My parents were generous to share this place.

"Before and after

Our beautiful barn with dance and yoga studio on the second floor. This place had so many dancing feet touch its floor, with dirty Cohasset feet full of joy. It allowed dancers to explore and welcomed growth while being among the trees, butterflies, squirrels, bats and yes mosquitoes.

It was a place we balanced, held an asana gazing out over the balcony, and meditated to the song birds and soft breeze of the wind in the trees.

Where children ran freely in utter bliss as they looked at themselves in the mirror and out into the forest. 

The barn and views of the property touched the heart and soul of all who were fortunate enough to step here

I will miss you barn.

May we stand together again somehow, someway, someday.

"Before and after

The front brick patio, where we sat on rocking chairs, gazing out into the abundant greenery of this beautiful land. 

The overflowing apple tree hanging so low we had to duck out of the way as we walked by. 

The front porch provided shade and coolness in summer months, protection and dryness in winter months when it rained and snowed.

I have incredibly fond memories of sitting with friends, family and my dancers at this location. 

We would reflect. 

We would share and dive deep.

We laughed so hard.

We sang along to music my dear friends played on guitar.

We tie dyed with my aunts at cousins camps or family reunions.

We watched babies knees get scraped from learning to crawl here.

We sat in community circles, holding space and being the change we wish to see in the world.

The feet that crossed these bricks were blessed to be a witness to this space and land.

Until we meet again.

"Before and after

The barn and tricycles

It actually brings me joy as I reflect on the decades of tricycle riding on this land. Mom and Lorenzo started it. They bought really good quality tricycles with fat tires, which meant adults and children could ride them. 

And I think the adults enjoyed these tricycles equally to the kiddos. 

The laughter while riding and the silly nature it brought out in everyone was priceless.

Live bands would play while tricycles were ridden

Kids bombed the hill from barn all the way to the driveway, no helmet’s, no. Just pure bliss.

@avantgardetricycle made a film with said tricycles while he attended @enchantedridgedanceretreat with @danaleelawton and I.

And now, again, I sit with memories and burnt tricycles.

Some days are harder than others especially when I see photos, hear stories and share memories.

I hope one day we can get some fat tire tricycle action again on the land and basketball court. 

That would bring me joy again

"Before and after

The most beautiful sauna and forest. Said sauna was built by my uncle Bruce when I was a child.

We sat inside to sweat all the toxins out, jump in the cold pond in fall, winter and spring. Ran and jump off the dock into the pond on gorgeous summer days.

We took saunas at night. Then lay on the dock to star gaze. We would reflect on life, how massive the universe is and how small we are as humans.

We took saunas in early mornings before dance classes.

We sang songs inside the sauna in the pitch black darkness at my reunion with friends.

The sauna was a treasure to this property. I will miss its heat and my aunt Trishie calling to moms to say when the sauna would be ready.

I am grateful for all the sweetness, sweat and hard work it took to keep it maintained, thanks to my other uncle Germain (and others who helped too).

Memories and blue skies around are all we’ve got now. I do not know if we will have a sauna again. There’s so much to build and care for. 

So for now, I remember.

GoFundMe might get us to a place to rebuild (link in bio too)

"Before and after

The pond and dock

The memories of adults and children running off the dock and plunging into the crystal clear pond, every summer, except when California was hit with a draught. 

The immense joy, laughter, challenges, flips, sunbathing, squeals, thrills, bliss and love for this beautiful spot on our property will never be forgotten.

The weddings of my sister @treesamahwood and her beloved Dean, my cousin Zeb and beautiful wife @puterbaughlaura Laura, our dear friend @annaramie to Sean and some who I don’t even know who were blessed to wed on said dock.

May we always remember.

May we remember we had the time of our lives here.

May we cherish the love witnessed here.

May we celebrate all the naked bodies that took a sauna, jumped in the water and enjoyed this part of the land. Yahoooo!

I remember certain people in our community swimming laps in the pond. What a gift that was. 

May we say thank you to my mom Susie Lawing and my aunt Trishie Puterbaugh for keeping this place beautiful until the end and always welcoming friends and family to experience the sauna, dock and pond.

"07/25 robber's spring junction, 33 miles & 6969 ft of elevation gain

the descent into belden was covered in poison oak, so I ran really fast so it couldn't get me and it worked  

before the big climb out of belden, some official forest service guy stopped me and offered a ride and let me know people were already bopping ahead due to smoke but I decided to send it anyways -a lil smoke never hurt nobody... Right? 

I almost stepped on the world's fastest rattlesnake that refused to move out of the trail, so I had to do some parkour over charcoal logs to get around it

the climb wasn't too shabby, and there was more shade than I expected and A LOT of water everywhere, as I got closer to the top, I was greeted by a big ol' wall of thick smoke (we talking dummy thoiccc) which kept getting worse throughout the day, but I was already committed at this point so I kept boppin

finally made it to the cascade mountain range!! yay closer and closer to home :)

hung out at a spring and an official vehicle rolled up, and we thought it would be someone telling us to evacuate, but it was some guy who worked for pacific electric. we chatted with him about the fire and he told us with confidence that we would be fine hiking on... however, two ish hours later we were getting rained on by ash and the sky turned orange which was a little eerie but was also giving badass apocalypse vibes 

felt like I was back on the AT due to the long side quests to retrieve water off trail, but the spring near camp was like a little fairy land 

camped with meatstik and we were harassed by some tweaker deer that kept staring us down and circling around us... they wanted our salts... they wanted our salts so bad. I just crossed my fingers that I wouldn't wake up to a deer licking the sweat off my feet. apparently, another hiker had their sweaty shirt stolen by a deer... nowhere is safe

During the tour, we introduced Jeff Popovich, Director of Global Warehousing for GEM, and provided a brief overview of how we utilize our Warehouse Management System (WMS) to manage all operations. Additionally, the Cal OES Public Information Officer (PIO) is scheduled to visit us in the coming week.

Now that the Park Fire has been fully contained, our GEM USA West teams have been actively working with affected families to support their recovery and assess their living conditions.

Seeing the footage of Hurricane Helene breaks my heart because they have experienced something just like we did. And so much more, so many more, and very big communities lives derailed also. The devastation is unreal. 

I feel it. 
I see it. 
I know it. 
And we keep on going, day after day, trying to figure out how. 

Sending blessings and support to all the states, communities and people hit by #hurricanehelene . 

May we all see what we’ve been through and know the grief and tragedy is very similar. 

Park took 3 firefighters lives. Helene took over one hundred lives. 

Park was fire
Helene was water

May we rise and be able to rebuild, find strength, get assistance and move forward.

"Park Fire Victim: Meet Penny the Great Pyrenees 

I'm sure if you've been watching the news you've heard of the Park Fire raging across Northern CA. It's currently over 353,000 acres and still going. 

One family completely lost their home and have nowhere for their beloved Penny to go. They are asking if anyone could open their home temporarily for this beautiful girl until they figure out their living situation. 

About Penny: 

6 years old
About 80 lbs
Fixed 
Behind on her shots.
Microchipped.
Great with kids.
NOT good with cats.
House trained.
Leash trained.
Excellent and fierce chicken protector but not formally trained for that. 

With proper introductions she could possibly do well with other dogs but she's not well socialised (she's been a hill dog and only knows 2 other dogs) 

The only health issue she's had is chronic ear infections that they've seen a vet for and only got under control when they took poultry out of her diet. Now She eats diamond lamb and rice and no more ear infections. She will have food donated with her and will be provided for her length of stay.

If you can help please text 760-215-1679.

 Finally reached the Midway Point of the PCT!  As I got closer, counting down, 200 meters... 100 meters... my eyes were already glassy, and it was hard to keep the trail in focus. And then, there it was: the Midway Marker. I was standing in front of it, realizing I had walked every single mile to get here. My friend turned to me and simply asked, “Are you crying?” I just nodded, and in an instant, tears streamed down my face. It was such a powerful moment, one that’s hard to put into words. We celebrated - what an achievement! It was unbelievable.

Their goal is to install erosion control structures before the heavy rains wash exposed sediment downstream, clogging culverts and harming fish. For this project, Corpsmembers first scope out the area to make sure no wildlife will be harmed. Then, they use rock bars to position big stones in the drainage area. Finally smaller stones are packed in between. This will act like a strainer, filtering out thick sediment while letting water pass through.
