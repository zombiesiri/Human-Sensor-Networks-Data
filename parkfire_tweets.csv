One point that Zeke Lunder makes in his commentary on the video (link below) is that the firefighters had to do this in mid-afternoon under dangerous conditions because the fire was bearing down on the road. It would have been vastly preferable to do this as a prescribed burn in the spring when conditions were much less extreme, and it would have been much less likely to lose control of the burn.

“Would you like to do your firing operation in May or would you like to do it on the 30th of July with 100-degree weather and swirly winds?”

An important point is that if we do not proactively perform prescribed burns under favorable conditions (easily controlled and prevailing winds favorable for minimizing smoke exposure), they will eventually be done in much worse conditions as part of an emergency firefighting operation, or the area will burn as part of a wildfire. You can't avoid fire on the landscape; you can only delay it.",,,,

Reed, Kevin ‘California’s Park Fire Could Burn for Weeks or Months’ WSWS, 31 Jul 2024 https://t.co/hk7e51Qrmi

<< The Park Fire is continuing to burn out of control and could become the largest in state history due to the exceptionally hot and dry conditions caused by capitalist-induced climate change. >>

""According to information published by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), the Park Fire has burned 386,764 acres in Butte, Plumas, Shasta and Tehama Counties and is 14 percent contained. This area is 12 times the size of San Francisco.""

""This level of containment means that just 14 percent of the perimeter of the fire has been enclosed by a control line. In other words, most of the fire is burning out of control."" ...

""The exceptionally hot and dry conditions are making for a record wildfire season on the West Coast. According to Inside Climate News, 'Over the past two weeks, infernos have been tearing through parts of California, Oregon and Canada, leaving scorched trails in their wake.'""

""Fire experts are saying the pace at which some of the blazes have intensified is shocking. Inside Climate News said that scenes like that of the Park Fire are playing out in Oregon and Canada, 'Experts say a ‘flash drought’ triggered by heat waves transformed trees, shrubs and greenery throughout eastern and central Oregon into kindling for lightning-ignited wildfires. More than 1 million acres have burned so far across the state — quadruple the amount of charred land compared to last year.'""",,,,

FFs have successfully held the 32 (huge victory), they've corralled the area where it punched through the 36, and the only *real* fire activity is where it's skunking around the Mill Creek drainage, where they have the most difficult terrain to manage. 
Much of CalFire's Hail Mary Highway through the wilderness has actually been successfully established, which is kinda mind-blowing. They may pull off the impossible. The efforts that private timberland operators have done over the years laid the foundation for their success, and they've exploited it beautifully. 

HOWEVER, I think it's highly likely that NE edge of the fire will push through that drainage and go farther NE. Weather is un-ameliorating. CalFire has done an absolutely spectacular job of taking advantage of the good weather days to construct a LOT of line, but today we will see an increase in SxSW winds, a decrease in RH, and some potentially double-plus-ungood T-storms will be pushing into CA through the weekend, so there's an increased chance of the fire waking up in the NE corner. The good news? What's to the NE of that fire? The Dixie Fire scar. This thing doesn't really have anywhere to go, given where it's *currently* aligned. 

CalFire is doing their best to try and protect private timberlands, but past fire activity in this area has been largely positive for the ecosystem, so no matter what happens, I'm not alarmed. Might not be a bad thing to see the fire fulfill its destiny up to the 32. 

Now, I keep saying ""CalFire"", but that doesn't mean you don't have tons of USFS and other agency personnel doing God's work on this fire. This fire started on CalFire dirt, so they're the Unified Ordering Point (UOP). They're in command of the fire, it's their budget, and they have a different mission than the USFS does, and they also have a different culture. I've often noticed that CalFire can be more aggressive with putting fire on the ground than the Feds are comfortable with. There are pros and cons to this. 

Sometimes you put fire down and it rips out of control, or people up the line aren't expecting it...can be bad. But sometimes, that bias for action pays off, and you save millions of acres of timber, houses, and lives. I don't think either approach is the right one, but on this incident, the bias for action in putting fire down along the 32 has been successful and paid dividends. I admire their huevos for doing it, and all the CalFire & USFS operators who pulled it off.

The last few days, the Park Fire has – mercifully – been boring. It's a welcome respite. The biggest risk now, as I've said, is other fires. We have a lightning bust pushing into SoCal starting today, and it will become more widespread moving northward through the weekend...major risk of lots of new starts. As we saw in 2008 and 2020...when you have a lightning bust bringing hundreds of simultaneous ignitions, you simply can't staff every one, and they all go to maximum potential.

Today is day 1 of Dirty August. We are now entering peak fire season. Buckle up.",,,,

[8/3]- As of this morning, the #ParkFire in California is 27% contained with more than 400,000 acres involved. 

The Fort Worth Fire Department Wildland crew arrived Wednesday evening for a 2-week deployment. Currently they are working in the Tehama Zone out of the Red Bluff Camp. This is located at the northern edge of the fire. 

The crew is part of a larger Strike Team. Their primary function is to support heavy equipment, hand crews and other engines within the division with line construction, hose lays and point protection for values at risk. 

The Strike Team (and Division as a whole) have lost a lot of tires due to the  incredibly rough terrain. The days are long, the work is tough but the impact of helping is more than worth it. 

Please continue to keep our crew, all the firefighters and the residents impacted by this historic wildfire in your thoughts and prayers. 

Stay safe, #fortworth.",,,,

Look how the fire largely bent around the 2012 Mill Fire scar. Wonder if there's a lesson in there?

The existing and upcoming handline is well ahead of this spot fire in the Mill Creek drainage, and in a perfect world, they'll let the fire get there. A little bit of a wind test today, so perhaps it will get there in the next few days. 

We're only looking at maps because that's the only thing to look at. Lookout cameras have all been turned away. The fire pornographers have long been gone, back home waiting anxiously for the next disaster to feast on...all while dozer operators continue pushing iron through the remote forest with a jug of coffee.

On Friday August 2, 2024, just prior to 2:00pm, Peterborough County Officers were dispatched to assist EMS at the Kawartha Highlands Signature Park. Information provided indicated that two friends were drifting in the river on tubes and one person had gone missing from their tube.
Officers arrived on scene along with Fire and EMS and spoke with witnesses. Witnesses advised that two individuals were drifting down the river on tubes. The first person got off their tube in roughly chest high water and was not wearing a life jacket. The second person got off their tube closer to shore and looked back to see the first person gone. The second party was able to locate the others tube but not the person. They attempted to search for the person but were not able to locate them.
Park Wardens were notified and a short while, the first person was located face down in the water.

Today’s highlights -
. Park Fire burns over 2MM acres. Transmission lines could (are expected to) be shut down.
. TS Debby is now Hurricane Debby Cat 1, set to make landfall in south Florida today.
. NYMEX prices dip below $1.90. Prices could fall further if Hurricane Debby knocks out transmission lines, lessening natgas demand for power generation.
. Dow Jones starts this week down over 1,100 points. Global markets are tanking as well. Nervous investors all over the globe. Massive selloffs. Japan sees single worst day since 1987.
. European natgas prices hit 4-week high, giving support to U.S. natgas prices.
#NYMEX Open = $1.95, High = $1.96, Low = $1.88, Current = $1.94. Down $0.15 from 1 week ago. Down as much as $0.75 from 1 year ago.
NYMEX CALENDAR YEAR ESTIMATES – 2024 = $2.42, 2025 = $3.17, 2026 = $3.54.
2024 NYMEX Monthly Average (through July ‘24) = $2.19. 2023 NYMEX Monthly average = $2.73.  2022 NYMEX Monthly average = $6.64.  2021 NYMEX Monthly average = $3.84.
We are below the 50-day ($2.46), the 20-day ($2.12) and the 9-day ($2.00) average.
RESISTANCE – Starting @ $2.02/$2.07.
THE PIVOT @ $1.97.
SUPPORT - Starting @ $1.91/$1.84.
BASIS – Both #PG&ECGBasisand #SoCalCGBasis prices remain elevated. Cooler weather (10 days out) and potential blackouts from the Park Fire could push Basis prices down.
The 2023 PG&E CG First of the Month Index averaged $9.83. 2024 averaging $3.24 through July ’24.
The 2023 SoCal CG First of the Month Index averaged $10.95. 2024 averaging $3.03 through July ’24.
The 2023 SoCal Border First of the Month Index averaged $8.14. 2024 averaging $2.45 through July ’24.
#LNG EXPORTS, #NatGasEXPORTS, #NatGasIMPORTS – LNG Exports = 12.9Bcf. Mexico Exports = 6.8Bcf. Canadian Imports = 6.9Bcf.
#PRODUCTION/SUPPLY & #DEMAND THIS WEEK –
Today’s Est. Supply = 109.2Bcf. Supply 7 Day Avg. = 108.8Bcf.
Today’s Est. Production = 102.4Bcf.
Today’s Est. Demand = 101.7Bcf. Latest Demand 7 Day Avg. = 101.7Bcf.  National demand will be VERY HIGH through Tuesday, then easing to Moderate-High.
#RIGCOUNT – The latest rig count (8-2-24) = 586 active rigs.  Oil remains the same at 482 rigs, natgas falls by 3 to 98 rigs, miscellaneous remains at 6 rigs. Compare that to 659 active rigs this time last year.
#STORAGE – The guesstimate for yesterday’s storage report was an injection of 33Bcf. The actual report shows an injection of 18Bcf.  We are currently 252Bcf higher than this time last year and 441Bcf above the 5-year average of 2,808Bcf. At 3,249Bcf, we are above the 5-year historical range. The latest Storage projections for Oct ’24 range between 3.87Tcf – 4.03Tcf. The March ’25 estimate is 1.63Tcf – 1.95Tcf.
#WEATHER – https://t.co/evIgBsS9U2’s 6-day forecast, “Hot high pressure will rule most of the US the next 2-days w/highs of 90s-100s for very strong national demand. There are cooler exceptions across the Upper Great Lakes w/highs of upper 60s-70s as weather systems bring showers, while also across the Southeast due to Hurricane Debby w/highs of mid-80s. Greater portions of the Midwest, Plains, Ohio Valley, and Northeast will cool into the upper 60s and 70s Wed-Sun.”
Today = Bullish. 5 – 10-day forecast = Bearish.  10-15-day forecast = Bearish. Aug – Oct forecast = Bullish.  Oct – Dec forecast = Bearish. Winter Forecast (Dec ’24 – Feb ’25) = Bearish.
     
Hurricane Season Update – FL, GA, and SC have already declared state of emergency in preparation for Debby.
#CRUDE – Down. Current Cash price = $72.29. Forward estimates: 2024 = $72.36, 2025 = $69.44, 2026 = $66.71.
#CALIFORNIARETAILPOWER – Grid Status = R.M.O. #CAISO declares Restricted Maintenance Operations for 8-5-24. Reasons = “high forecasted loads and ongoing fires threatening transmission facilities”. - Grid Status = Normal. CAISO current pricing = $31 - $54.
#CaliforniaPowerGeneration % = NatGas @ 47.2%, RE @ 17.5% (66% of that from Wind), Solar @ MINUS 1.3%, Hydro @ 9.8%, Imports @ 17.1%, Nuclear @ 8.4%.
#CARBONOFFSETS – California and other states will be mandating companies buy carbon offsets, starting as early as 2025. Is your company ready for that mandate? Better to get ahead of the 2025 demand – more options, greater price range. We can help.
THE BOTTOM LINE – There is a LOT of uncertainty throughout global financial markets, and that includes NYMEX natgas. NYMEX prices dropped below $1.90 for Sep ’24. We could see natgas gluts due to a drop in power demand as Debby moves up through the Southeastern seaboard, taking out power plants/transmission lines. Take advantage of these opportunities because they do not last.
RFP ES is now providing energy in WA, OR, CA, NV, AR, NM, (parts of) TX, PJM region, Mid-Con region, Gulf States region, NC, and VA. So, going forward, rather than having a massive indicative daily pricing sheet (that changes by the minute), we will simply quote any requests you may have on an individual basis. We will still report on NYMEX and Western Region Basis movement.
ALSO – If you would like an indicative/executable quote, you can simply go to https://t.co/s6w55GhkEl and submit a Request for Proposal (RFP). THE RFP will be sent to all our supply partners who are supplying energy in that region. You choose the time and date you would like to receive the quote – please give 48 hours from the time you submit to the time you want to receive the quote. It takes less than 5 minutes to submit a request for proposal.",,,,

“If you were to suddenly walk into a smoky room, you'd likely instinctively cover your mouth and stop breathing—at least while you find your way to cleaner air. Trees don’t have the luxury of running from smoke, but they do ‘hold their breath’ when exposed to it, researchers have discovered.

While ponderosa pines don’t have lungs, the trees take in carbon dioxide and emit oxygen through small pores in their leaves called stomata—an exchange that researchers liken to breathing. A team of scientists happened to be studying these pores and the compounds going in and out of them in a forest in Colorado in 2020 when smoke from the season’s nasty fires settled in. They were shocked to discover that the trees completely closed their stomata in response, “effectively holding their breath,” they write in a piece for The Conversation.

Ponderosa pines are a common species in the Northern California forest where the Park fire currently rages, so it’s likely that they—and perhaps other plants—are holding their breath in this manner while firefighters try to contain the blaze. Why they might do this isn’t clear. When people breathe in wildfire smoke, the small bits of ash can wreak havoc on their insides . It’s possible these tiny particles harm plants’ internal organs, too.

Whatever the reason the trees stop breathing, with fires increasing in frequency, size, and severity because of climate change, it’s more important than ever to figure out the effects of smoke, the researchers behind the study say.”

At about 4:38pm, Turlock Police and Fire was dispatched to a call of sick person at Central Park, located at S. Golden State Boulevard and E. Main Street.

It was reported someone was turning blue in the face, possibly overdosing.

Upon arrival, units reported that NARCAN was administered.

AMR arrived on scene and transported the patient.

Another person was arrested on a warrant.

Police reported that the patient was the same person who overdosed at the same location last week.

Stay clear of the area if possible and beware of the environment around some the parks and areas seeing an increase in transients and open drug use.

****

Ever since California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered State agencies to start removing homeless encampments from public properties, Turlock has seen an influx of homeless/transients/vagrants - especially back in the Downtown district (where homeless shelters and services are located).

Newsom said that his executive order was in the interest of public health - something Turlockers have been stating and advocating for years in the best interest for our community and citizens (and the transients living in what turns out to be an open-air drug market with garbage spread all over).

Many say that Newsom is just trying to clean up cases of failure that will look bad for Kamala Harris - the Democrat POLITICAL Party’s pick to run for President after Joe Biden was pushed out by the Democrat big donors.

This follows an example of how Joe Biden stopped President Trump’s border policies like “Remain in Mexico,” but then Biden reinstated it back to what Trump had - only after a flood of illegal border crossings from South America came through Mexico and got pushed over into America.

Turlock City News has also received messages about white busses dropping off people at the Lander Avenue Exit, off of Highway 99. We are looking into this as well.

The Turlock Police Chief, City Attorney, and Turlock City Council have planned to discuss the impacts and/or changes to enforcement of illegal camping in public spaces since the June 28, 2024, Supreme Court overruling of the Grants Pass decision by the federal Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

In addition to the planned discussion about Grants Pass being overturned, this will most likely include a discussion regarding the negative impacts of the Newsom executive order - which appears to have directly caused an increase in homeless/transients/vagrants here in Turlock.",,,,

They were talking about suppression repair yesterday, and today they are worried about the fire pushing into Mineral. At least they have prepped around that community extensively. I’ve been told Heavy equipment is scattered and overhead doesn’t know what they got, and head fire is slamming dozer line that folks were told not to burn off. That’s very odd to not fire off dozer line when you expect head fire to slam into it.

California: The Park Fire has escalated dramatically, with multiple reports indicating severe challenges in containment. Numerous resources demobilized today after the fire breached a 16-blade-wide dozer line. Footage shows the intense situation, with another dozer burning and its operator sustaining burns to the face and neck. Multiple crew members also suffered burns while attempting to control the fire.

Initially, suppression repair was the focus, but the current concern is the fire's advance towards Mineral. Despite extensive preparation around the community, the fire's unpredictability has left heavy equipment scattered, and command overhead is reportedly struggling to track resources. Oddly, there was a decision not to burn off the dozer line, even though a head fire was expected to impact it.

The fire, which started under dire circumstances, continues to pose significant challenges. The influx of messages indicates a growing concern that the situation is deteriorating rapidly.

California: Scenes from inside the Park Fire today… Crews had to pull back and shelter inside vehicles after fire activity increased dramatically. The fire is over 414,000 acres now and about to become the 3rd largest in California’s history.

The dramatic photo captures the intense, fiery essence of the Park Fire near Mill Creek in Tehama County. Towering plumes of thick smoke are set against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, with majestic pine trees standing as silent witnesses to the chaos. Mill Creek is known for its proximity to Lassen Volcanic National Park, where bubbling hot springs and fumaroles tell stories of an ever-active geological past. This region, part of the Lassen National Forest, is rich in natural beauty, with its rugged landscapes and serene waterways like Mill Creek itself, offering a haven for outdoor enthusiasts.

Historically, the area has seen its fair share of natural events, from volcanic eruptions to wildfires, each shaping the land and its communities. As the fire consumes vast swaths of forest, firefighters face unrelenting challenges, battling not only for the land but for the legacy of these ancient woods. Local communities, with their roots deep in the soil of Tehama County, hold on with resilience, much like the towering trees striving to stand tall amidst the onslaught.

As the third-largest fire in California's recorded history, this monumental event reminds us of the delicate balance between nature and human intervention. The image, captured amid these formidable conditions, tells a story that is both heartbreaking and a powerful testament to the enduring spirit of those standing at the frontline.",,,,

CALIFORNIA FIRES  
Park Fire, the 4th Largest in California History‼️

The Park fire, the largest wildfire currently burning in the United States, has torn through over 426,000 acres in Northern California in recent weeks and has destroyed hundreds of homes and other structures.

The fire ballooned in size in a matter of days, and it is the largest blaze in California so far this year. Thousands of firefighters and other personnel, some from as far as Utah and Texas, are battling the fire, which was 34 percent contained as of Wednesday.

The hot and dry weather has made it difficult for firefighters to suppress the blaze, which is spreading northeast within Lassen National Forest and “ascending slopes with critically dry fuel,” according to Cal Fire. But forecasters say the coming days could bring lower temperatures and higher humidity levels in the fire zone. 

Current unseasonably warm temperatures are expected to steadily fade and give way to highs in the 70s next week.
“It’s not a dramatic change, it’s slow. But each day is getting a little better,” said Eric Kurth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Sacramento. “That’s certainly helpful.”

California's largest wildfire of the year, the Park Fire, continues its relentless march, consuming over 660 square miles of timber as it rages through the state. Igniting on July 24 near #Chico, the blaze has rapidly expanded, devouring the western flank of the Sierra Nevada.

With no end in sight, firefighters are battling the inferno in extreme conditions, as scorching temperatures and dry weather fuel the flames. The fire has already forced numerous evacuations and threatens more communities as it advances through the parched landscape.

Tehama County, California,

A firefighter uses a drip torch to burn vegetation while trying to stop the Park Fire near Mill Creek. The blaze ignited in a park in the city of Chico and exploded, burning through the rugged canyons and tinder dry grasslands of the Lassen Foothills to the rural mountain towns of Cohasset and Forest Ranch. 

In just a few days, it became the fourth-largest fire in state history.

Other areas of the fire saw reduced fire behavior as a cooling trend pushed into the area this weekend, bringing with it higher overnight humidities. This has allowed crews to further build fireline and bring containment up to 36%. 

Suppression challenges have been plentiful including extremely receptive fuels and topography such as deep drainages the fire got into. The cooler weather should help until a warming trend starts again next week.

The Park Fire, #California’s largest wildfire of the year, has burned over 660 square miles (1,709 square kilometers) since it began on July 24 near Chico, growing significantly due to hot and dry weather conditions.

As of Thursday, containment of the fire remained at 34%, despite efforts by firefighters to control its spread.
The fire initially became California’s fourth-largest wildfire on record before reduced intensity last week due to favorable weather. However, it has intensified again this week because of heat and low humidity.

While much of the burned area is in the mop-up stage, spot fires continue to pose challenges. The northeast corner of the fire remains the top priority for firefighting efforts.

The fire has destroyed 636 structures and damaged 49 others. A local man has been arrested for allegedly starting the fire by pushing a burning car into a gully.

Resources from the Park Fire are being redirected to combat a new fire in El Dorado County, the Crozier Fire, which has already burned over 2 square miles and threatens 1,625 structures.
Firefighters are using techniques such as drip torches to manage the fire's spread, and officials emphasize the ongoing need for vigilance and hard work in the coming days to prevent further destruction.

A 4.4 magnitude earthquake rattled the Los Angeles area on Monday, sparking immediate response from the LA Fire Department, which quickly went into ""earthquake mode."" The quake, which struck near Highland Park, was felt across the city, but initial reports indicate no major damage or injuries.

Residents throughout Southern California reported feeling the tremors, though structural damage appears minimal. Authorities are continuing to monitor the situation as they assess the impact of the quake, which follows another tremor in the region earlier this week.

I missed the fire emojis the first time I saw the screenshot because, apparently, my brain isn't broken the way their brains are.

But I did catch that the scooter is in the remains of the #JusticeForTylor sacred fire (scare quotes not needed) that, despite visiting multiple times¹, the scooters (specifically #CreepySpouseInDaHouse) were denied footage of by the presence of #sp411star signage.

I mean, except that one frame that they took out of video and removed the text from the image. 

This pair is psychologically COMPELLED to post evidence of their stalking and besetting, but think they're going to make a case for a ✌""cross-country criminal conspiracy""✌²? Literally, every time the ✌""conspiracy""✌ comes into play, it's because her oversized goon is harassing someone.

When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.""

In the journey of faith, we navigate through varied landscapes — some lush and serene, others rugged and intense. Isaiah 43:2 brings us a divine promise of presence and protection that transcends all circumstances. It's a reminder that no matter what we face, we are not alone; God is with us, guiding and guarding every step.

This verse is not merely about survival; it's about triumph. It assures us that in God's company, the waters that threaten to overwhelm us become passageways to new strength, and the fires we fear transform into refining experiences that leave us unscathed, shaped, and shining brighter.

Today, let this promise uplift your spirit. Whether you find yourself wading through challenging waters or walking amidst the flames of trial, remember, God's presence is your constant. His strength is made perfect in our weakness, turning our trials into testimonies of His faithfulness.",,,,

We are conducting research where we take conditions over the course of a fire and warm the background climate to see what we expect fire intensities to look like in the future. We also simulate fuel reduction treatments to see how future warming and fuel treatments would simultaneously affect a fire over its lifetime.

Below, this procedure is applied to California's Park Fire. The black line shows the calculated potential for fire intensity over the Park Fire's lifetime (using a weather forecast for a few days in the future). We see tremendous variability driven by changes in weather, topography, and underlying fuels over the course of the fire.

In particular, we see daily peaks in fire intensity as it gets warmer and drier in the afternoon, especially when this coincides with strong winds. Also, the amount of fuel and how dry that fuel is are huge drivers of fire intensity potential.

In addition to the black line, which represents the severity of the Park Fire under today’s climate and fuel conditions, the colored lines represent the same Park Fire progression in 2050 temperature conditions, with and without hazardous fuel reduction.

In 2050, the temperature conditions are about 1.5°F warmer, translating into drier fuels more conducive to higher-intensity fires. The red and magenta lines show the situation without hazardous fuel reduction. We see that the red and magenta Fire Intensity Potential lines are almost universally higher than the black Fire Intensity Potential line, indicating that the warming in the 2050s does increase fire intensity. Sometimes this climate change component is quite large. For example, on August 5th, this increase was about 25% from around 400 to around 500 megawatts. However, hourly and daily weather variability is much larger than this climate change signal.

It is important to note that two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios are shown. One is a slow emissions reduction scenario that roughly represents current global policies (SSP2-4.5), and one represents fast emissions reductions that are much more aligned with the Paris Agreement (SSP1-2.6). The movement from the slow emissions reduction scenario to the Paris Agreement scenario represents major differences in the global energy and agricultural economies, technology adoption, geopolitics, etc. Yet, these differences translate into only marginal changes in Park Fire’s 2050 intensity.

When it comes to addressing wildfires, greenhouse gas emissions reductions are often heralded as the primary lever we can pull. However, trying to influence weather-related outcomes through energy policy is incredibly indirect and there are often much more direct solutions at hand.

https://t.co/Ec8oDEZPDj

In that vein, the blue line represents the progression of the Park Fire in 2050 under slow emissions reductions (4.5) but with hazardous fuel reduction. Not only is the blue line always below the red and magenta lines, meaning that it would reduce fire intensity over the fire's entire lifetime, but it is also typically below the black line, representing the Park Fire in today’s climate.

This means that even in a situation of 2050 warmth, under a slow emissions reduction scenario, hazardous fuel reduction would reduce the Park Fire’s intensity relative to today.
