"While we are gratefully ok here in Laurel Canyon some of our friends have lost entire homes. We know 8 people right now who have lost everything and will need to rebuild. This is going to take a huge community effort. This is the only way we will make it through. 
Our dearest music teacher @smilingmountaingoat lost everything & the wonderfully talented musician @_jacqueline_michelle also lost her home, while both are safe they are in need of support 
There are many more however these are just two of the special friends of mine who my heart is breaking for 
I’ll be gathering together some items for them and have donated to the go fund me links on their pages

"Paradise Lost -

Thank you all for the overwhelming outpouring of love — your messages, texts, emails, and calls mean more than you know.

We are all safe. That is what matters most. But beyond that, there are no words to soften this blow.

I was still in the Philippines when I heard about the fires. I clung to hope, convincing myself that the news might be exaggerating, that my home — my sanctuary — would somehow be spared. But it wasn’t. And now I am left to process a reality that feels impossible to comprehend: my home is gone. Burned to the ground.

The walls that held laughter, the quiet corners where I found peace, the treasures passed down from my mother, my grandfather, my best friend — ashes. The echoes of their stories, their touch, their presence are scattered to the wind. The memories are mine to hold now, but the tangible reminders, the irreplaceable pieces of my life… they’re gone.

I am gutted. I walk through the shadows of what was and struggle to reconcile the devastation with the paradise I once knew. But even in this loss, I remind myself: home is not just a place. Home is the love we build, the connections we cherish, and the stories we carry forward.

To everyone who walked through my door, the ""enchanted door"", shared a meal, laughed until the sunset— thank you for being part of that space. The house may be gone, but the memories we made together will never be lost.

“I once had a home in paradise and now it is lost. But though it’s gone, paradise will forever live in my heart.”

We will rebuild — in one way or another. Grief comes in waves, but so does strength. I will find mine. Thank you for standing with me. #palisadesfire #malibufire #malibustrong",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DEpRwt0t-TW/,2025-01-10 12:24:20+00:00

"My neighbor Kyle and I were having a glass of wine in front of our homes as we were getting our garden hoses ready, the fire was still far away, but fully thinking we were going to be warriors, protect our homes and fight off the fire heading our way.  Once we realized that wasn't a reality, I left my wine glass in the planter and off we went.  Leaving our home for the last time.  And this is what survived the fire.

"The air is heavy with smoke, a constant reminder that the fires are still burning.

Here in LA, it’s hard to describe this feeling of living life as usual while destruction looms just a few miles away. The Palisades Fire, the Altadena Fire—they’ve consumed so much. And yet, right here in my neighborhood, things feel almost normal. People are walking their dogs, grabbing coffee, chatting on the sidewalks.

Our home is fine, and for that, I’m endlessly grateful. But I can’t stop thinking about those who aren’t as lucky. Entire families and businesses left with nothing but ashes.

And yet… amidst all this heartbreak, there’s hope. I’ve seen LA show up for one another in ways that leave me speechless. 

Donation centers are popping up everywhere. Restaurants are feeding evacuees and firefighters. People are stepping up to find lost animals, foster displaced pets, and give shelter to the creatures who can’t ask for help themselves. It’s a reminder of just how big our hearts can be when it counts.
Social media has become a lifeline, flooded with resources. People are sharing everything: where to find temporary housing, free furniture, and even tips for navigating the nightmare of home insurance. It’s incredible to see how quickly communities can come together and support each other.

It’s overwhelming in the best way possible. This outpouring of love, kindness, and empathy is a reminder that even in the darkest times, light finds a way. And in this city, that light burns fierce.

"A Home That Stood Strong  On January 7, the Pacific Palisades wildfire tore through Los Angeles, leaving devastation in its wake. But this home, designed by architect Greg Chasen, survived thanks to smart design choices and fire-resistant materials.  

Here’s how it withstood the flames:

✅ Fire-Safe Materials
*  Fire-resistant wood: special heat-blocking layers behind the walls and heat-treated siding helped prevent flames from spreading.
* ️ A metal roof with fire-resistant underlayment stopped embers from penetrating.
*  Tempered glass windows didn’t shatter under extreme heat, keeping fire and smoke out.
*  Defensible space: No vegetation near the house + concrete garden walls.

✅ Smart Design
*  No eaves, overhangs, or attic vents that could let sparks in.
*  Airtight construction stopped embers from sneaking inside.
* ️ Special ventilation systems filtered out smoke, keeping the air safe to breathe.

This home shows what’s possible with thoughtful home design and a focus on resilience. It’s also inspired me on my own journey to build a wildfire-resilient, solar-powered home in San Diego. ☀️

After seeing wildfires devastate my hometowns of Sonoma County and Lahaina, I’ve spent the past three years learning how to design a home that can withstand the challenges of California wildfires. It hasn’t been easy, but it’s going to be worth it. ❤️‍

Let’s build homes that protect lives and communities. ✨

 Follow @californiahomedesigns for more tips on wildfire-resilient design, sustainable building strategies, and creating safer, stronger homes!

"moonfire ranch  Home to Lewis Marvin lV talking here where he lived at Moonfire.  Many in Topanga know his very tall brother Max who walks thru town center. Lewis & Max are the sons of Moonfire Ranch creater Lewis Beach Marvin lll. 

Lewis Beach Marvin III, trading stamp heir & animal rights activist, photographed here at Woodstock in 1969. Marvin devoted his life to protecting animals & raising awareness of veganism at a time when there wasn’t even a name for it. After spending early years following the prescribed journey of a wealthy family – economics degree, a stint at Oxford - Marvin had an epiphany in his early 20s, as told to LA Times in 1973. “I believe if you turn your stomach into a grave for [animals], then the law of nature will get even with you by giving you a heart attack.” His life mission to promote a meat-free lifestyle, Marvin often attended festivals & concerts to promote his message. At Woodstock, he was also the one who passed a lamb (and his trademark hat) to Jim Morrison onstage at the Doors’ infamous 1969 Miami concert where he was arrested for indecent exposure.

In 1957, Marvin bought a 60-acres in Topanga Canyon, creating his own hilltop retreat and animal sanctuary called “Moonfire Ranch” to represent the symbols of life and death. Building by hand a two-story living space that included rainforest-wood walls, a giant chandelier, 20-foot-tall windows overlooking the ocean & reflective pools. An early adopter of solar power, Marvin relied on rainwater & back-up generator to run the property that, over the years, was home to his wife and three kids, sheep, goats, llamas, peacocks and one famous camel named Boney Bananas – who was noted by an LA Times reporter to eat its hay out of the window of Marvin’s Cadillac limousine. 

Boney Bananas the camel actually eventually fell to his death off a cliff in Topanga. 

Moonfire Ranch mesmerized Hollywood. In '66 a temple was built for Paul Newman's film “Harper” & later a regular spot for Jimi Hendrix, The Doors & Janis Joplin & more. Hippies & free-thinkers flocked the ranch in the 1960s & 1970s. Marvin passed away in 2005, ending decades of silence.

"Mariposa and Olive

This is one of the last if not the very last surviving wood A-Frame house in Altadena that looks exactly how it did when it was built in 1924 by famous author, Kyle Onstott. Kyle was also a competition dog trainer. Prior to the construction of these houses the lot was used as his dog kennel. Outside of the four house houses subdivided on his lot, nearly every other house in the area was destroyed. This house is significant because it sits dead center in the historically Black area of Altadena and represents what many of the houses looked like at its peak.

 What I do in real life: I’m a journalist and documentary filmmaker, bringing light to important global and local stories.

 How I got involved with Volunteer Squad: Seeing the devastation caused by the fires, I felt compelled to step in and support those affected. Joining Volunteer Squad has given me a way to channel that into action.

⛑️ What I’ve been doing with The Squad: Today, I had the opportunity to help one person who lost their home, providing them with food and clothing. It was a small but powerful reminder of how much a little kindness can mean. I look forward to contributing more in the days to come.

 What I want to share: Every act of service counts. Meeting someone face-to-face and being part of their journey toward recovery is deeply humbling. This experience is a powerful reminder of the resilience and strength within our community.

"2 things I've learned during the LA fires

1. Stop shoulding on yourself

And 

2. why finding The Thing behind The Thing is crucial to moving forward and getting out of self-sabotaging ruts.

""When we understand what's driving
our patterns, we can start to make
shifts. But the magic isn't in simply
understanding. 

""It's in taking action
that gets us out of our rut. It's in
writing when I'm not sure where the post is going to go. 
It's in showing up a little messy and uncertain, but showing up and being visible as an expert in what I'm talking about.
Even when I'm going through the
healing process, too.""

See the update & message of gratitude from Casey in our recent post by visiting our profile to see how much of a BIG difference your support makes!!

We are so happy that Casey, his partner, and Teeka were reunited with Oreo. Just one example of Social Compassion’s rescue efforts, and why it’s so important to save every animal we can - for the animals and for their human families! 
Thanks to;

 We have been in contact with Casey since the rescue and will work with him on legislation, “Oreo’s Bill,” to help prevent pet owners like him from being prevented from saving their animals.

If you have read Judie’s book, you are already familiar with Jane Garrison. The book includes their harrowing rescue efforts at Hurricane Katrina. Judie and Jane reunited this past week to help the LA Fire victims.

Wildfire zones can be full of toxic materials, sharp objects, and irritants, which is why decontamination is essential for protecting our K9s’ health. It also gives us a chance to check for injuries and ensure they’re ready for whatever tomorrow brings.

Even so, in the midst of this sadness, we’re finding quiet strength and leaning on each other as we take small steps forward, together.

"Appreciation post for the home I loved so deeply. She was comforting, she was kind, she was open to all. If you know me, you know I loved being there. I loved hosting. I loved leaving my keys with friends so they could enjoy the space I adored so much. This year I had big plans: spend a lot of time at home. 2025, Mother Nature, the universe, fate, whatever you like, had other plans. It’s eleven days after evacuation and what I think is ten days after the house burned down. I keep thinking of the little details, the touches, the memories, the things lost in the fire, and I don’t know if that will stop for the foreseeable future, but that’s ok.  It’s still unbelievable, but with every day reality sets in more. Sending strength to all of my fellow Angelenos who have all been impacted in some way by the devastation over the past week. And to the place I looked forward to waking up in, the place I looked forward to coming back to, thank you, home.

"LA Friends! 
These are a few of the items that your local assisted living center or nursing home might be in need of if they took in evacuated seniors. 

Trial size toiletries like toothpaste, deodorant, face wipes, combs or small brushes, chapstick, face washcloths, warm socks, hand lotions, and if you really want to make bathing easy on caregivers for bed-bound folks, dry shampoo or rinse-less shampoo caps and sponges. 
Many seniors are still displaced. If you’re interested in putting together some sweet senior care items but don’t know where to take them, message me and I can send you the updated Dept. Of Health list of where residents from different homes were relocated to. 
These are little things but could really brighten someone’s day who may feel confused and in limbo. ❤️

"Members of AMRT responded Friday and Saturday to the search efforts related to the Palisades Fire. 

They spent both days working with Marin County Urban Search and Rescue, @lacountyfd LA County Fire, and Search & Rescue teams from around the state surveying structures. 

The first day was spent in Malibu while the second day was in Topanga Canyon. 

Over the course of two days, all search teams involved cleared more than 600 houses.

Please join us, and our friends from @d.pizza.spot in Leimert Park this Sunday, January 19th, for a special fundraiser to support the displaced families of the Eaton fire. In times of need, it is important to band together as a community to assist others. We are bent, but far from broken. 

We will be set up on 43rd Place and Crenshaw just outside of the park. The families we wish to support are in need of essential hygiene products and women’s self-care products. Please refrain from bringing clothing items. As there is a much greater need for the items listed above. 

All monetary proceeds from pizza sales will be donated to @sliceouthunger to continue feeding families in need. Thank you in advance for your attendance. We look forward to serving you! ❤️

"Save A Life (Foster or Adopt), Part II:

For everyone who read my last two posts, you know I’m donating many of my services (100% discounted) to anyone who FOSTERS or ADOPTS a pooch from any of the LA shelters or rescue organizations taking in displaced pooches from the recent fires. A huge THANK YOU to @montecitojournal for spreading the word within our wonderful and caring community. Even if we can’t all foster or adopt, at a minimum let’s spread the word about the pooches who need us—and let’s encourage anyone thinking of bringing a pooch into her or his family to please consider fostering or adopting 

Almost all of the animal shelters and rescue organizations in LA desperately need the community’s help to relieve the dire overcrowding at their facilities from the hundreds of displaced animals (not just dogs) taken in since the fires began. Many shelters can’t accept any additional animals, including dogs, because they simply don’t have anymore space. By fostering or adopting one dog, you are not only saving this dog but you are helping to create the space to save another dog.

Perhaps the only thing greater than creating a life is saving one, which is why I’m donating my services, including my 2-hour “Connecting Parents & their Pooches” first-time bonding session, at a 100% discount to anyone who saves a life during this time

Repopulation has begun in some areas and we have been reducing road closures as these areas are deemed safe for entry. 

Some of our closures will remain in place as utility and highway maintenance crews work to repair infrastructure damaged by the fire. Thank you for your continued patience as they work on repairs.

It came on faster than anyone can ever recall. 
Yes, the wind was moving quickly. But there were
at least three other key factors:
1. The LA City FD, which has jurisdiction where
the fire started, failed to pre-position nearly as many
units as it was supposed to in windy conditions.
2. The FD failed to deploy the Quick Reaction Force
helicopters right away – likely due to an urban fire 
fighting culture that emphasizes trucks and boots
on the ground, using copters later, only if needed.
(The County FD fights more brushfires, so better
appreciates the QRF approach.)
There were other aspects of negligence too.
The question is whether any of them rise to the level
of liability – it's a high bar where public agencies are concerned.
3. Fountain grass, a rapidly burning invasive,
had come to dominate the nearby hills over
the past few decades, providing a fuse-like path.
.
I have more photos of the aftermath. Would you
like to see more, or are they too triggering, or...? 
Let me know.

"Hi friends, not exactly sure where to go from here so going to dive into helping and working…everything I’ve been working towards this past year is gone, I put myself in serious debt trusting my path to create the most advanced reverse aging center in the most perfect location in the Pacific Palisades in the building the new @equinox opened 12 days before the fire and now our town is devastated.  I’m currently safe down at my lovely friend @ashleeilauren ‘s.  

All I can do at this point is surrender to the infinite power of the universe, trusting the master plan to unfold for the greatest good. 

As I’ve already put so much effort and love into the reverse aging center I’m going to transition it into a wellness recovery space, still located in the Palisades. If you’re interested in supporting through modalities, donations, operations or however you can please reach out. 

Also, if you or you know someone thinking about selling, leasing, or looking for next home, I’m here to help. I have a fantastic, caring, good people team. It would be all wins for us all and I’d be very grateful for the business. 

Blessings!

"Dealing with property insurance and related claims in connection with the recent L.A. and Altadena area fires? 

 Here are a few resources you may find helpful.

Navigating the aftermath of the L.A. and Altadena/Eaton area fires can feel overwhelming, but the right resources make all the difference. 

Tune in today at 1 PM PT @kbla1580 - I speak with Attorney Amber Finch, a top global insurance recovery attorney with the law firm Reed Smith LLP, on The Legal Lens Show about the most common challenges wildfire victims face when dealing with insurance claims.

This discussion covers essential tips for documenting damages, avoiding common pitfalls during the claims process, and understanding your insurance policy and rights. 

If you miss the show, the episode will be available next week on the Legal Lens Podcast for on-demand listening - make sure to follow me to know when it’s available ️

Reed Smith LLP has also compiled expert advice into a great article, to help simplify the claims process. 

Additionally, the California Department of Insurance is hosting workshops and offering wildfire-specific resources to guide residents through this challenging time.

"Please Share!

On December 19, the day I left LA for NY for Christmas, I took a long walk around Pacific Palisades. Weather was picture perfect, lots of people at Cafe Vida and the local shops in the Village were all busy with everyone getting gifts.

I spent most of my walk on Sunset, headed towards Pacific Coast Highway, a beautiful part of the Palisades. I noticed something sparkly on the ground near Palisades Lutheran Church. It was the ornament pictured here. I almost left it there, but decided otherwise and put it on my tree when I got home.

Between the holidays and the events of the last couple of weeks, I forgot about the ornament, but was reminded of it when I took my tree down yesterday.

Looking at the ornament, all I could think of was the child (and their family) who made this ornament. Did their home survive? Did they lose all their Christmas ornaments in the fire? Are they ok?

So, looking to the power of social media to connect the ornament to its rightful owners.

Please share; my hope is that getting this ornament to its proper home will serve as comfort during a sad time.

"This $83 Million Masterpiece is the latest high-profile victim of the Los Angeles fires.

Images published this past weekend revealed the Pacific Palisades mansion notably featured in Succession season 4 — where the Roy sibling planned to unroll “The Hundred” before scheming against family patriarch Logan Roy — had been reduced to ashes. 

Four years ago, this property shattered residential sales records in Westside Los Angeles after it was acquired by Russell for $83 million. Prior to that, it was available to rent for a not-so-casual $350,000/month. 

Beyond its recent destruction, this lavish abode had previously been the subject of countless headlines thanks to a wide array of next-level amenities: a retractable roof, retinal scan access to the extravagant master suite, and two panic rooms.

The 20,000-square-foot trophy home also offered six generous bedrooms, 18 bathrooms, and all the integrated tech you’ve likely only experienced in fiction.

The aforementioned retractable roof found in the master could be configured in either an open sunroof-like setting or with a glass pane to keep the elements out. The cherry on top? The ceiling also doubled as a projection screen.

"Partly off-topic:
I took this pic for obvious reasons in November 2023 during a stroll through the Pacific Palisades. According to the damage map, the house should still be standing unscathed. But starting literally two streets ahead, entire neighborhoods were wiped out. 
It’s been over a week and I still fail to grasp the extent. For almost three years I’ve dealt with air alerts apps and friends losing everything to bombs. Now in addition, it’s the Watch Duty app and rebuild sites as other friends or people otherwise dear lost everything to fire.
I might laugh and joke but specifically last Saturday I felt sick to my stomach and I wonder how many tears I have left to cry.
Thankful for the firefighters and everyone who prevented an even worse outcome.

My family and I are currently in the hardest chapter of our lives - but it’s also revealing the power of resilience, community, and the urgent need for change.

To everyone who’s shown us love, strength, and solidarity - you are our light in this darkness.

It wasn’t just my home that burned down, sadly so is the trust in the leadership and systems supposed to protect us

I have faith that the only thing more powerful than the wildfire that just burned thousands of homes, 

will be the community that comes together to rebuild it.

Thank you for being part of something bigger.

"This is my Sunday morning prayer for those that have lost homes, animals, or loved ones in the recent #palisadesfire , #franklinfire , #altadenafire , #sunsetfire , #kennithfire or any of the recent 2025 #losangelesfires .

Isaiah 61:3- God can exchange beauty for ashes- “To bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness…”
•
I believe that we all can heal, we all can grow, it will take time, the support of others, and digging deep within ourselves to find that inner peace again that I believe only God can give us. Let us grieve together, and grow together. We are here for you. #californiastrong

"Resting After a Unified Recovery Effort

Today, our team, along with all eight search teams from across the county, is finally getting some much-needed rest after many intense days of search and recovery efforts at the Eaton and Palisades Fires. During these operations, we had the honor of working alongside incredible Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams from across the state. Together, we searched burned properties, supporting families and communities impacted by these devastating fires. 
 
This model of collaboration between the fire service and volunteer SAR teams is rare, typically reserved for large-scale incidents like these. The teamwork, dedication, and professionalism displayed by everyone involved were truly exceptional and played a vital role in recovery efforts.
 
We extend our deepest gratitude to the USAR teams for their hard work, hospitality, and camaraderie throughout this mission. Though we never hope to face such tragedies again, we stand ready to serve our communities whenever called upon. 
 
Stay safe, everyone, and thank you for your continued support. Together, we make a difference.  #Teamwork #SearchAndRescue #MontroseSAR #community #EatonFire #PalisadesFire #LASD",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBFsLWyQ68/,2025-01-19 18:20:38+00:00

"Rebuilding After the Palisades Fire 
On January 7, 2025, the Palisades Fire changed my life forever. My beloved home of 14 years was left uninhabitable, and I lost nearly everything—my belongings, my community, and the sanctuary where I built so much of my life and work.
The kindness and support I’ve received so far have been overwhelming and deeply appreciated. Thanks to this incredible community, I’ve reached 17% of my $75,000 goal. But there’s still a long way to go.
Your generosity can help me secure safe housing, replace essential belongings, and start rebuilding my life. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a meaningful difference.
If you’ve ever been touched by my work—my film Yoga IS, my coaching, or my online platform—or simply feel moved to help, I humbly ask for your support.
 Please consider donating or sharing my GoFundMe page. Together, we can create a brighter and more hopeful future.

"⚠️ @southcoastaqmd - As smoke and ash is blown from the #EatonFire and #PalisadesFire, it’s important to take precaution if you see ash or smell smoke.
Windblown ash particles may be too large to be detected by air quality instrumentation and not reflected in the Air Quality Index (AQI) map. However, they are typically visible to the naked eye either in the air or on outdoor surfaces. Although the AQI may show green, hazardous ash may be present in the air.
 
If you smell smoke or see ash, please take precautions: https://bit.ly/42mv9nY

"For those who know me, you know my lifelong dream was to be an SFFD firefighter. Unfortunately, due to my accident, I never realized that dream—but here I am, 10 years later, at the firefighter base in Malibu for the Palisades Fire, and I had the honor of meeting some of the SFFD team.

Not only did I get to say hello, but I had the privilege of adjusting these incredible heroes who have been working tirelessly, some for 7–14 days straight. They’ve been sleeping in rigs and tents, all while continuing the fight against the fires.

I’m beyond grateful to support these real-life superheroes—firefighters from Colorado, California, Wyoming, and beyond. Watching dolphins in Malibu while serving those on the frontlines has been a surreal and humbling experience that reminds me of God’s goodness.

They deserve a parade, our gratitude, and every bit of support we can give. Thank you for your courage and sacrifice!

"(Please scroll through and read about these incredible people)

This is a photo of a group of people that live in Rustic Canyon just below the Pacific Palisades. It is a small group of some of us who stayed inside to do what we could to save our little neighborhood which was barely missed by this fire. 

As things come to what I hope is some closure to this horrific event I thought I might share something. I don't use this platform much and do not fully understand it or how it works, but what I do know is there are a lot of people looking at it. I hope if you do see this you stop to read it. Because this small group of people deserve just a little attention. They have my attention and forever will now. Please swipe to read about these incredible people in this photograph.

And I think I can speak for all of us when I say: While our minds were focused on saving all of our homes, our hearts were with all of those that lost theirs.

"So here it goes my first non hair related post… changing my handle to : ashleighmarieusedtocolor and turning this into a personal account until I go back to work when Axl is school age. 

These last two weeks have been intense to say the least. I’m so proud of how so many people in LA have stepped up to help those in need who were devastated by the fires and lost their homes. I hope those affected are healing and recovering from such a traumatic experience. 

LA is full of amazing people, it’s been my home all my life and my favorite place in the world, but it’s changed. I no longer feel safe in the city especially now that I have a family. The crime is rampant and people have become desensitized to it. 

On top of that the fires have created a toxic environment in the air, water and local food supply. That was why when we evacuated we went out of state and will not be returning to protect our health. I know the skies are blue and people are living life as normal but I consider myself very health conscious and I can’t turn my check and ignore my instincts on this one. 

So that’s it! I’m walking away from my dream career, dream home, my lifelong friends and family to escape the sinking ship that is California. The city has been ravaged by the blue policies left to pillage and leave it in ruin. Just my two cents, not looking to argue politics, but rather to give reason to why I’m taking such a strong stance and leaving as abruptly as we did. 

Thank you to everyone for your continued support and I’m very optimistic about establishing a better quality of life and reinstating a sense of safety in my nervous system. TX has a lower cost of living, better schools, my son can go to school unvaxed, the seasons are mild and oh the people are so kind! 

So there you have it, why I’m leaving and why TX. Welcome to my new personal page and new life  #lafires #pacificpalisades #palisadesfire #latodallas",1008400982,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBkaenxzxV/,2025-01-19 22:49:06+00:00

"I have this book of reminders I wrote myself next to the door on the way out, held open by a crystal rock my dear friend gave to me. It’s turned open to a page that feels most comforting to me. Out of anything I have ever written, I go back to this again and again because it speaks to the impermanence of circumstances and the duality of the nature of life. Light and dark, ebbs and flows, tragedies and triumphs. Life is mysterious but we know for certain that no one thing lasts forever. Not the good experiences and not the bad experiences. Life would not exist without both. Life would not be life. We just experienced a historical disaster in California (a tragedy I wish with all of my heart did not happen) AND the we in the LA and greater LA community are already rallying together to help rebuild. We, as a nation, are about to experience a major change tomorrow AND we will experience another one in 2028. Take it from me, 2025 has already been a long four years in California I can’t imagine more chaos, but we must continue trusting in the nature of life — her demand for balance — and never let the bad bury us so when the good comes we are able to see it. I hope this supports anyone feeling the weight of it all right now.

"I went to Los Angeles on January 10th, to see close friends and family, many of whom have been deeply impacted by the devastating fires. As a UCLA graduate, much of my crew is in LA, and I felt a deep need to be there in person—to hug them, support them, and remind them they are loved and they are not alone. While there, I brought my 35mm camera and walked the streets of Altadena, Pacific Palisades, and Malibu, for four days straight, photographing the destruction these fires had on homes, communities and lives. Block after block, my heart fucking broke more and more, but as I spent 15 years of my life making documentary films, it has been foundational to me as a human to bear witness to the world. At times I questioned why I was even taking photos, but I felt compelled to document what I saw through my lens and share it for all to see. Capturing these images felt like a way to preserve the history of this moment, to honor those we lost, and to hold space in my heart for everyone whose lives have been irrevocably changed by the fires. Los Angeles, we love you.

"Last week, Los Angeles faced unimaginable devastation as wildfires tore through our city, leaving neighborhoods reduced to ashes. As I watched the news, I cried with every family who lost everything—rich or poor—it didn’t matter. My city was in pain, and my heart broke for it.

I wasn’t born or raised in LA, but this city is where my dreams came alive. It’s where I learned how to be strong, where I understood what adult life truly means. Los Angeles has given me the happiest moments of my life. I still remember the first day I arrived here 14 years ago, the instant connection I felt with its energy, its diversity, and its boundless possibilities. I fell in love with LA and proudly call it my HOME.

The first restaurant I ever went to in LA was Moonshadows @moonshadows_malibu in Malibu. That place, like many others, has been taken by the fires. But even though these physical spaces are gone, they live on in our memories. I think of all the beautiful times I’ve spent in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, and it fills me with gratitude for what this city has given me.

These wildfires have brought me closer to LA than ever before. The wildfires have shown me a side of LA that I will never forget—a city where the strength of its people shines brightest in times of darkness. I’ve seen neighbors supporting one another, strangers uniting like family, and communities coming together with unmatched determination to rebuild. Los Angeles isn’t just about its palm trees, sunsets, and dreams—it’s a city built on resilience, kindness, and an unbreakable spirit.

The world saw our grief, but it also saw our strength. To everyone who lent a hand, shared a kind word, or simply showed up to help: you are the angels of this city. Together, we are rebuilding not just structures but the spirit of this extraordinary place.

"I had to see it for myself. After covering the fires from the studio for nearly 2 weeks, watching our crews do their incredible reporting, I wanted to see it firsthand. This is a slice of the devastation from the Palisades Fire. Entire streets decimated. The smell of smoke as strong as if the fire was today. Charred vehicles, standing door frames and chimneys, Christmas lights still visible. The hop-scotch nature of the flames apparent. A single home left untouched here and there… surrounded by ash. The National Guard, fire and utility crews really the only signs of life. There are no words. My heart goes out to the thousands impacted here and in Altadena ❤️❤️‍

"Hello! I wanted to original start ""Sole Food Gamer"" shorts with sonething fun, but unfortunately with the beginning of the new year with Los Angeles burning. I felt it a little crass to talk about relating to food, games, sneakers, or fun in general ( don't get it twisted, those articles are primed and ready to go.) Still I wanted to talk a bit about some of the consequences of the fires. Even though smoke is in the immediate milage around Pasadena, Altenda, Palisades, and Eaton. There is still lots of fallout, chemicals, ash still in the air. Being a Long Beach native I am about 40 miles away, but I still am affected especially since I suffer from allergenic rhinitis. As mentioned online and in the news; if you have to be outside for any considerable amount of time. Make sure you have a N95 or P100 mask. There was a small shortage the first week, but they are in stock again at Home Depot and on Amazon. The mask help a lot. As an example; once I am exposed for more than an hour outside. I get nasal congestion and a cough. Also when driving use the recycled air button in your AC so you don't breathe in the toxins. While the main Palisades fire has reached the 50% mark and Eaton is 80% mark. We aren't out of the woods yet for air safety.

"No words.

The devastation wreaked by the Eaton and Palisades fires in my hometown has me shaken and grief-stricken to the core. I struggle to find words of inspiration, although I am grateful to be alive and for the first responders who are fighting these fires. But for my community, my heart is broken. 

The house above is not ours. Although we evacuated, the fire did not reach our neighborhood…this time. 

The same cannot be said for many close friends in Altadena, Pasadena, the Palisades, and Malibu; for their friends and neighbors—entire communities that have been destroyed and will never be the same. 

This house belonged to our dear friends Marcus and Shawna Beer in Altadena. They evacuated around 4am in the dark on Jan 8 and lost everything, along with all their neighbors. Everything has been reduced to chimneys and ash. 

It is impossible to replace all that has been lost, and the road to recovery is going to be long and hard.

If you can, please consider a donation to help those who lost everything such as via GoFundMe (you can find the Beers GFM in Bio @saucela ) or to a vetted organization providing wildfire relief. Every little bit will help.

We were spared but I have no words and my heart is broken

"Two Individuals from Oregon Arrested for Impersonating Firefighters within Palisades Fire  

“On Saturday, January 18, 2025, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Major Crimes Bureau investigators were contacted regarding an arrest of two suspects for impersonation of firefighters.  An LAPD patrol unit was driving through the Palisades Fire area with fire personnel and observed a fire truck that did not appear to be legitimate. They relayed the information, and Sheriff’s deputies contacted the individuals in the fire truck as they attempted to enter an evacuation zone.

Upon contacting the two occupants of the truck, deputies noticed they were both wearing turnout gear. The occupants claimed to be from “Roaring River Fire Department” in Oregon. Upon further investigation, the deputies learned that the department name was not a legitimate agency, and the truck was purchased at an auction.  The two occupants were wearing CAL-Fire t-shirts under the turnout gear, helmet, and radios.

The two admitted to being in the evacuation zone on Friday, January 17, 2025. Deputies arrested Dustin Nehl, 31, and Jennifer Nehl, 44, for Impersonating a Firefighter and Entering an evacuation zone, and the truck was impounded. 

Suspect Dustin Nehl has a criminal history in Oregon for criminal mischief and arson.  Neither have a criminal history in California.

Investigators will be presenting the case to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for filing consideration on Tuesday. 

Attached are photographs of the vehicle and gear recovered.

Anyone with information about this case is encouraged to contact the Major Crimes Bureau at 562-946-7893. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you may call “L.A. Crime Stoppers” at 800-222-TIPS (8477).” #losangeles #la #palisadesfire",212999109,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFCAd9nvxoP/,2025-01-20 02:54:14+00:00

"Spent a lot of today prepping for another predicted wind event starting early in the morning. It was nice to pull up at the shop on a cold LA night to find lots of people out supporting our local restaurants. Please keep it up! It might seem like the right thing to some NOT to shop or eat out--I've heard comments like wanting to give us space and time to process--but what we small businesses need is you! 

We need to work, and we need to re-order product from our small brands, and we need to support the many local brands, factories and services connected to what we all do.  Because behind every store, brand, factory, etc. are humans trying to provide for themselves and their families. And we're all so connected. 

Thanks so much to everyone who's supported our small business communities since the fires began. If you're at all able, please support small independent businesses in NELA no matter where you are. If you need recs, we've got them. 

Finally, to everyone out there who has supported victims, firefighters, evacuees, and pets, there aren't sufficient words . Hoping this community-minded support we're seeing from all over the world becomes a model for how we care for each other in times of crisis.

"My heart goes out to everyone impacted by the recent LA fires, as well as anyone who has previously had to deal with devastating wildfires. This hit particularly close to home…literally. I consider myself incredibly lucky that we had a house to go back to after we evacuated, but my heart breaks for those who didn’t and/or lost lives in the process. I wanted to do a little something to help, so I designed a limited edition shirt that people can wear as a signal of support & encouragement for everyone involved. 100% of the profits will be donated to Watch Duty, a nonprofit that was instrumental in keeping people informed & safe during this devastating time. I truly don’t know what I would have done without their app during this surreal & terrifying time. I want them to be able to help anyone who may have to deal with wildfires in the future, and this is the little way I can contribute. ❤️ Please consider purchasing this shirt from my Etsy shop (link in bio), donating to a cause of your choice, volunteering, reaching out to someone you know, or simply sharing this post. Thank you so much, and stay safe! 

Sincerely,

"I just wanted to take moment to share my sentiments towards the boys of the Los Angeles County Fire Department Camp 8. I had the privilege of walking the line with these boys as they put the first boots on the ground in response to the Palisades Fire. To witness the system at work was mesmerizing. The communication, the work ethic, the camaraderie were second to none and it left an immediate impression. Crews left it all out on the line and nothing could have prepared either them or myself for what was to come. There will be more to follow I wanted to get a few more shots up to give them the support and credit they deserve. They too almost lost their home and fought through some of the harshest fire behavior to save their Camp that same night, which was badly damaged and are in need of as much support as we can give them. In addition, I would like to thank you all for your love and support these last days. I cannot reiterate how much you all mean to me.

"In the worst moments of humanity, the best of humanity always shows up. —José Andrés

City of Angels

I feel like a cat with nine lives, and I just used up two of them within four months of each other.

During my current seasonal stay in Los Angeles, an Evacuation Warning alert sounded on my phone. A raging blaze in a nearby community, known as the Eaton Fire, rapidly grew in strength due to an unprecedented weather event that generated hurricane-force winds. A similar scenario played out last September in Lake Arrowhead (see my 9.21.24 post).

Thankfully the flames never reached my LA neighborhood, but thousands of other folks weren’t as fortunate. In the blink of an eye, the Eaton Fire decimated half of Altadena and parts of Pasadena. On the other side of the city, the Palisades Fire incinerated nearly 75% of Pacific Palisades and stretches of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.

More than 25 people lost their lives, and many others remain missing.

Huge heartfelt thanks to the angelic souls, especially @losangelesfiredepartment , who showed up without hesitation to assist those in need. Here’s how you can help the helpers:

@baby2baby seeks donations for diapers, formula, baby food and blankets.
@habitatla needs volunteers and donations to assist with rebuilding homes.
@laanimalservices has issued an urgent plea for fosters and adopters to take pets from its crowded shelters.
@mercychefs seeks donations to feed free meals to people displaced by the LA wildfires and those still affected by Hurricane Helene in Asheville, NC.
@pasadenahumane requests help fostering pets displaced by the fires.
@projectangelfood needs donations and volunteers to fill delivery routes and kitchen shifts.
@wckitchen accepts support through donations and volunteers to feed free meals to impacted neighborhoods.

The dawn of a new day brings hope and promise to the devastated areas of our beloved city. Let there be no doubt, LA has more than nine lives and will rise from the ashes better and brighter than ever.

The power switched off at 4:25 PM, and I could no longer track the fire by the media copters on TV. So I hiked up the hill for a quick peek where I'd have a better view, overlooking the nearby neighborhood. 
Back at the house, while prepping my fire hoses and gear and packing more valuables in the Jeep, I still figured the firefighters would be showing up any minute. With all those houses between the fire and me, surely they'd make a stand and keep the flames from spreading further. At the very worst, we'd be fighting the fire side by side.
But zero firefighters showed up. At least not until the vast majority of those houses had already been consumed.

The shelters have not been as inundated with small animal intakes as was predicted. We understand The Humane Society of the United States is providing emergency aid to veterinary clinics and local animal welfare organizations.

Petco teams are working with various LA shelters, including LA Animal Services to help get shelter animals either adopted or fostered to open up shelter space. The teams are also helping with trying to reunite pets with their families using the Petco Love Lost app.

Organizations like FieldHaven Feline Center are working hard to set up water and food stations within the burn areas for misplaced pets. Critical as this mission is to saving lives, it has been a tough to accomplish. Law enforcement is not allowing animal rescuers (aka “unofficial organizations”) into the burn areas to search for and get the animals out, or allowing teams in to set up the water and feed stations. “Pet owners begging for someone to go to their houses to check for pets are being ignored,” wrote Joy Smith of FieldHaven Feline Center. “Rescuers have a curfew of being out of the fire zone by dark. Very, very few cats will be found in the daylight.”

Who is in charge? This is not meant to be a judgmental question, but an effort to help and connect. It is a question we keep seeing. There are organizations willing to help. Who should they connect with to receive orders and direction to proceed?

"Today, as we honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we are reminded of his words: ‘Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’

In the aftermath of the Eaton and Palisades Fire, we reflect on the loss and devastation our communities have experienced. But even in the face of adversity, it is imperative that we are steadfast in protecting and rebuilding our communities.

Dr. King’s call to serve others will be evident in our actions. Let’s come together as a community to support one another, just as Dr. King envisioned—a legacy of unity, resilience, and service. The healing and rebuilding begin now. Be kind to one another.

Beyond being of service in the community, we want to also provide helpful information to all of those who may be concerned about the effect that the secondary particle pollution will have on the health of their pets. The effect on air quality from the fires poses a serious risk not only to people but also to pets. These tiny, unseen particles can cause long-term health effects.

"STORYTIME  Firefighters from Station 10 Red Mountain have been assigned to the Palisades Fire as part of a Type 3 engine strike team since January 9th. While the crew of Engine 3361 was having a meal at a local restaurant, a young boy named Axel was captivated by the sight of our engines. 

With great enthusiasm, a firefighter invited Axel to explore the engine and sit behind the wheel, making his evening unforgettable. The joy on Axel’s face reminded us why we do what we do, it’s more than just fighting fires; it’s also about making connections.

Thank you Axel for the wonderful opportunity to put a smile on your face. It’s moments like these that fill us with pride, joy, and gratitude!

"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  was a man of integrity. He gave his life standing up for the truth that we are all equal and worthy of LOVE! He was a leader worth following. His teachings will heal humanity if practiced. His teaching showed us LOVE in Action. 
This past week and a half, volunteering giving services to evacuee’s, next to the helpers, the beautiful souls who just show up to help other humans find ease and grace when they are grieving the loss of their homes and belongings. This week Dr. King’s teachings were in action with empathy and love. 
These next 4 yrs I know I will do my best to continue being of service. To go where the love is and to speak up when I see injustice. Thank you Dr. King.

"Heartbroken today. For Los Angeles, for America, for things in my own life. For the climate future we’re facing that’s increasingly baked in daily. People always ask “is it scary photographing fire” and my answer is usually not since safety comes first, and firefighters are the ones in true danger and harm’s way, I’m just in the background. The adrenaline and focus and intensity of the fire is almost a given.

What’s harder, and scares me more, in destructive and deadly fires like these, is the aftermath. You pour all your energy and soul and heart in trying to make pictures, document honestly, deal with work being stolen, disinformation, negotiating for fair freelance pay.  Having to go back to normal life like invoicing, walking the dog, laundry, all seems rather pointless for the first few days, and the lingering feelings always differ. 

Everyone affected by the fires should take time to rest, reset, grieve, and give themselves the grace and space in their own minds to decompress and seek whatever they need to get through. Whether that’s counseling, rest, a vacation, a hike, snuggling with your pet, screaming into the void, it’s all valid. Letting your nervous system reset and physically allowing your body to relax is critical. 

This is the reality for the rest of our lives, and there will be more destructive wildfires in California and the American West. It’s a matter of when, not if. We have surpassed the point of what human resources and technology allow for fighting the most extreme blazes, and all we can do is get people out of the way, and try and go in after and save whatever possible. We will make changes to water infrastructure and fire staffing to maximize tools in the firefighting toolbox, but when it hasn’t rained for 9 months, humidities are in the single digits, and wind gusts top 100mph on the mountain peaks, physics dictates the tempo.

Climate Whiplash (Swain, Nature, 2025) is real and here. So take care of yourself, because this is a marathon. Image taken from the beach in Santa Monica, the first night of the #PalisadesFire",137242643,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFDxiQByQuj/,2025-01-20 19:22:14+00:00

"Some of my favorite photos I’ve taken so far from my days at the front line feeding first responders. From billowing smoke from a new fire flaring overhead to witnessing heroes in juxtaposed moments along the beautiful seashore to falling ash retaining the shape of its original subject, it’s been a time we’ll never forget. This event looks way different. Coming together to feed firefighters who haven’t eaten in days. Donated product goes to those in need instead of influencers. Star Wagons line Base Camp instead of a movie set. This city is judged for being shallow and superficial but it is anything but. If you look hard enough, you’ll find this city is full of grit, hustle, creativity and determination. LA brings entertainment, film, music, television and art to the world. Embraces you no matter who you are and where you come from. Makes so many people feel seen and heard. It’s also a city full of dreamers, workers and small business owners. I’m proud to call this place home, and that won’t change any time soon.

"If you find yourself in shoes like mine, you may feel overwhelmed trying to navigate the torrent of emotions stirred by the devastating wildfires in LA County. Because of this, I’ve woven together a tapestry of ideas to help you through this trying time.

First, acknowledge your emotions. Take comfort in the knowledge that it’s entirely natural to feel what you’re feeling, and remember that you are cherished and safe. Remember, you cannot pour from an empty cup. This important step must be completed before moving on to anything else.

Next, turn your focus toward the helpers, volunteers, and first responders. Illuminate for yourself the ways neighbors are uniting to foster healing. If you are able, consider joining these noble community efforts. Strive to steer clear of conspiracy theories, tales of looting, and unverified information.

Keep up your normal routines wherever possible. In times of upheaval, a thread of normalcy can weave a calming effect. Treat yourself to a small delight, listen to your favorite music, or indulge in a soothing face mask. Small joys can make a world of difference.

I’m sending endless love and support to our beloved LA community. Should you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a professional. Take care of yourselves and your families, and let us know how I can help. I am ready to support you.

"⁣Hi everyone, I don’t even know what to say. Just THANK YOU! ⁣Thank you for being the most amazing community ever!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ $830… WTF!!!!!
⠀
⁣Honestly, when I started this ⁣fundraising campaign a week ⁣ago, I was really unsure if I should even do it. I thought maybe it would come across as weird... what could I possibly achieve with my tiny reach? But then I was like... whatever, who cares?! Every dollar counts! Maybe we could even raise $100 for a good cause.⠀
⠀
⁣But it wasn’t just 100$, it ended up being a mind-blowing 830$ that I was able to donate to @pasadenahumane on your behalf this morning!!!!! Your donation will help them to provide food, medicine and a safe shelter for all the animals burned, injured or displaced in the wildfire! 
⠀
⁣A special thanks to my friend Laura from @craftyhomes_berlin, who prints and ships the mugs in Germany! Without her help, this would never have been possible!!! 
⠀
Again,⁣ to everyone who bought a mug, shared the post or told friends about it... THANK YOU!  I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the best thing I’ve ever done! I know it’s just mugs - I’ve heard that saying a lot - but look at what even mugs can do! What we can do together!  If you have a pet, give them an extra-special hug today! ❤️‍

"⚠️ Long post...=>
Dear LA, dear America,
Where do you go from here? California's dreamin' is burning.
Ecran de fumée rouge. Feu qui remplace ton smog. Champ de guerre plutôt que décor hollywoodien où les héros ne portent pas de cape.
Cité des Anges, ville des rêves qui s'envole(nt) en fumée. 

LA, where do you go from here? 
Leçon d'entraide comme seule l'Amérique, pourtant déficiente à bien des égards, peut en donner.
Esprit de communauté au sens large dont l'Amerique seule peut se targuer. 
LA, Cité des Anges qui n'a pas volé son nom.

But...
America, where do you go from here? 
Ton futur est aujourd'hui aussi sinueux que la route de Mulholland. Ton avenir égalitaire aussi noir que les collines de Palisades.
Une cité en cendres et, désormais, des lendemains apocalyptiques. America, ça sent le soufre.

So long LA. 
La route 66 s'arrête bien là. 
See you in 4 years. Still standing, stronger.

Le feu s'éteindra , pas le rêve. 

God bless America.

"After natural disasters like wildfires, it’s normal for people to feel overwhelmed, scared, or even act out in ways that are hard to understand. While most will health and return to their usual routine, the journey is different for everyone.

For teens, these events can be even harder to process. It’s normal for them to feel scared, confused, or uncertain. But here’s the good news: teens are resilient! Even those affected by trauma can recover with the right support.

Create a safe, open space for teens to ask questions and share their feelings. There’s no “right” way to have these conversations – just listen, be honest, and offer reassurance.

For teens, distress may last longer, and that’s okay. If feelings anxiety, sadness, or fear don’t subside after a few weeks, reaching out for support is key.

At Neuro Wellness Spa and Clear Behavioral Health, we specialize in tailored mental health care for teens and their families. Together we can navigate tough times and help your teen heal.

"Happy cats =  happy campers! 

One of the biggest miracles from the fire was that my three cats survived! The fire captain said my home was 5 mins from succumbing to  the flames.‍For hours afterwards, we searched the smoldering rubble with no signs of Kit Kat, Burrita and Miley. Just as I was about to give in to despair, by some miracle all 3 of them emerged from the chaos after all the firefighters had left!

In the aftermath of the fire, everyone kept telling me to surrender my fur babies due to the instability of my living situation. But how could I? My fur family were living reminders to me to have hope and be grateful, no matter how dark the circumstances. Everything else is replaceable except human life- and the lives of our fur babies.  

While the stories and images of loss in So Cal have been  unimaginable, the stories of all that were saved miraculously by brave firefighters and compassionate non-profits serving in the front lines have been heartwarming amidst the tragedy. 

❤️‍If you’re looking for a tangible way to help, consider adopting OR fostering a cat from these rescues in LA, Santa Monica and Pasadena  @bfas_la @kitty.of.angels @pasadenahumane who are doing all they can to save animals in danger from the recent fires. ❣️

I stood on the shore watching. Listening.

"Seeing all the devastation in person - there are few words to accurately describe the intensity of it all. As of today, the #EatonFire is 87% contained but many roads are still blocked and there are still fire engines, power company trucks and construction equipment going in and out of every street. Many residents say their immediate needs are temporary housing and financial assistance. It’s going to be a long road for the people of Altadena (and the Palisades) ❤️‍

"It has taken some time to process, but I feel compelled finally to write something about the Palisades fire. My family moved to Pacific Palisades when I was 12. I’ve walked these boulevards and roads so many times. I’ve explored these canyons and stream beds as a kid, played soccer in these parks and streets, and learned to surf at these beaches. I grew up and learned to build homes seeing my father’s projects come to fruition. It was a magnificent neighborhood to grow up in- where the Pacific Ocean meets the Santa Monica mountains, where you feel simultaneously part of a world-class city and a small town in America. I was so lucky.

Today, I drove through this once great neighborhood. My mother lost her townhouse in the fire with nearly all of our family heirlooms. So many friends have the same story. It’s devastating to see many of the places I remember well as a kid turned to toxic rubble and ash. And it’s humbling to behold the power of nature- how fleeting and small I feel today before a great natural disaster such as this that we just lived through. What this community built in 100 years, nature was able to destroy in less than 48 hours.

In these times, I’ve recalled that great cities like San Francisco burned to the ground before and have recovered and thrived again. Similarly, the city of Chicago and London. These cities were rebuilt better than they were before. I sincerely wish that these iconic Los Angeles neighborhoods, Pacific Palisades and Altadena, will one day also recover and be beautiful, homely places to live and raise families. 

We will recover. We will heal. One day at a time.

"For those who know me well, you know that California has been my home away from home for the past 10 years.

So many of my incredible friends have lost everything in these fires. My thoughts and prayers have been with the greater Los Angeles area over these past couple of weeks. The devastation is unimaginable, and I’m truly at a loss for words.

There are countless organizations we can donate to during this time. We often justify spending $8 on a Starbucks coffee every day—what if we all donated just $1 to help those who have lost everything and are now rebuilding their lives?

Just something to think about.

Sending all my love to you always, LA. ✨

"It’s taken me some time to process the devastation here in Los Angeles enough to try to put it into words. Instead, I wanted to share photos that capture what’s been happening. This city has been my home during UCLA and again for the past 5 years now. It’s one of only two cities that has ever felt like home to me, aside from London. Seeing the destruction and devastation right in my neighborhood of West LA, somewhere I always felt was “safe” because it’s close enough to the ocean air seems so naive now. Seeing the smoke in the air day after day, watching my favorite places crumble into ashes, and sitting with my friends as their homes disappear has left me with a heavy heart. Somehow, everything still feels surreal, even as I walk outside and see ash all over my garden. Despite the fact that it feels LA has changed forever, I’m grateful to have my home and know my friends and family are safe and seeing everyone come together at a time like this has hopefully shown the world that LA is so much more than all the stereotypes. I ♥️ LA and always will. Thank you to all the firefighters and emergency workers for their bravery, we’d be lost without you.

"On the day we lost our home in the Pacific Palisades fire, I witnessed something I’ll never forget - the absolute heroism of firefighters.

These men and women weren’t just fighting flames; they were fighting against limited resources and impossible odds. 

No excuses. No hesitation. Just pure heart, grit, and courage.

When the fire reached our street, I found myself begging them for help. And without a second thought, they acted. 
They showed up for me, my family, and our community in our darkest hour - risking everything to fight for a home they had never even stepped foot in.

I’ll never forget the compassion in their eyes as they battled with everything they had.

I’ll never forget the sacrifice - the way they put themselves in harm’s way to protect lives and homes they didn’t know, for people they’d never meet.

Their strength wasn’t just in their gear or their training; it was in their unwavering commitment to serve.

A heartfelt thank you to @andrewmott101, Tony, FR115, Engines 105, 4, 26 and all the others. To everyone who took a stand at my home on Jan 8 - going so far beyond the call of duty. Even though it didn’t end the way we hoped for my home, knowing that these heroes did absolutely everything they could somehow makes beginning this next chapter just a little bit easier.

These aren’t just firefighters. They’re husbands and wives, parents, sons and daughters - everyday people who step into the extraordinary to protect us all.

To the firefighters who fought for our home, and to those who continue to fight for others everywhere — thank you.

Your courage, sacrifice, and service will stay with me forever.

Please take a moment to honor these heroes - and if you know one, remind them just how much they mean to all of us.

❤️‍ FREE COMMUNITY RESOURCE:
To our Los Angeles community,

There aren’t words to capture the anxiety, grief and loss of this past week. We send love to those who have lost their homes, and we are in deep gratitude for the tireless efforts of our firefighters, first responders and volunteers.

Our collective nervous systems have been in a constant state of hypervigilance.

When crisis strikes, we go into fight-or-flight to meet the task at hand. Yet once we are in a safe and secure place, it’s highly beneficial to move the anxious energy out of our systems and bring ourselves into a state of regulation.

It’s crucial to tend to our mental and emotional states and take time to ground, connect, and release.

While we are in the process of building something new, we’d like to hold and support our community with 6 months free access to WellSet — our virtual holistic healing studio.

There are over 1000 holistic classes and practices to support you in meditation, breathwork, EFT tapping, qi gong, yoga, somatic stretching and more.

Processing these events will take time — and supporting your nervous system is more important than ever. We invite you to put your oxygen mask on first, so you can be present for your community and loved ones.

A good place to start is our 21-Day Nervous System Regulation Collection.

"✨Interesting clouds before Sunday's sunset with pink light beaming into the ocean. Hopefully the ocean is recovering from the Palisades fire. 

Caught a kitesurfer tearing across the bay in the cold wind. 

Note the charred remnants of homes washing up along the shoreline. Thoughts and prayers still with everyone experiencing loss of any kind.

Actually feeling pretty good with my new David Lynch goggles! ✨ Not even joking.  His viewpoint of glorifying eccentricities really embraces all aspects into the depth and absurdity of humanity.  #directedbydavidlynch 

Thought for the day: An optimist believes we are living in the best of all possible worlds. A pessimist fears this is true.

"Join us this Friday, January 24, at 10 AM PST, for an emotional and powerful HSC&A / IG Live with artist Camilla Taylor (@camillataylor), who is mourning “over 20 years of artmaking” that was lost in her West Altadena home studio. 

We are humbled for this opportunity to virtually visit one of the thousands of properties lost to the Los Angeles wildfires and to give those of you outside of L.A. a sense of the new and difficult reality many artists are now facing in our city. 

Camilla will share what it means to navigate such an immense loss while continuing to work. From their early days as an artist to the profound challenges of rebuilding their life and studio, this conversation underscores the strength of a creative spirit in the face of adversity.

We’ll also explore the importance of place, the role of community support, the impact of artmaking in difficult times, and the importance of disaster preparedness for artists and art workers.

"Days after the Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed over 12,000 homes and forced the evacuation of more than 88,000 Californians, the impacted areas had yet another threat to consider aside the indifference of fire. 

After evacuation orders came, entire neighborhoods were rendered ghost towns, and opportunistic crime such as looting became yet another variable the already devastated residents were forced to contend with. 

Disregarding the evacuation orders, six locals of the Rustic Canyon neighborhood remained. Isolated from their family and friends by police and National Guard blockades, with limited power and water, they were some of the only residents that remained behind the lines.

The locals had individually held back the fire using garden hoses and whatever tools they could get their hands on until the immediate threat of the fire had subsided. However, the residents had to continue to fight to protect their homes, neighborhood, and community even after the flames had ceased to lick at their doorsteps. The individuals quickly coalesced into a posse, standing as a watch group for their neighborhood.

An unspoken agreement was formed between the posse, police, fire, and National Guard units, as their simple presence became a massive form of deterrence of its own. The posse constantly patrolled the neighborhood, chasing away looters, responding to break ins, and answering desperate calls and texts from their neighbors who had hastily evacuated and didn’t know if their homes were ransacked or burnt. 

The group had fought fires with zero training, chased out looters, took care of elderly residents who did not evacuate, and coordinated with official and private entities as they worked the uphill battle of securing their bit of the evacuation zone, all the while eating out of thawing freezers, and basing out of one home that was still somehow with electricity. 

This is community. Blair, Brian, Jonny, Tim, Sean, Kevin, thank you all for taking me into your community. It has been a profound experience meeting you all.

My heart and sympathy goes out to the LA community and residents who were affected by this tragedy. As well as all the first responders and their families who also made a large sacrifice to stabilize this incident.
The damage and loss that this fire caused was devastating and unimaginable to witness.

And, thank you so much to everyone who reached out to me, Brittany and Allison with your support throughout this event. That response was very heartwarming and motivating for me. I felt the love and thank you all very much.
Also, thanks to our Taken Days family and fans for holding it down while i was unexpectedly gone for all that time. Thanks Corey and Landon

"Meet Avery Colvert, a remarkable teen from Los Angeles who turned tragedy into action. After her community was devastated by fires, Avery launched the Altadena Girls Recovery Fund (@altadenagirls) to support those impacted. What began as a small effort has now turned into a powerful movement, rallying people together to rebuild and heal. 

Avery's school, Eliot Arts Magnet Academy (@eliotartsmagnet) in Altadena, Calif., burned down in the Eaton Fire. Though her family home in Pasadena fortunately survived, most of her friends lost everything. “There's maybe a small handful of people I know whose houses are spared,” she says in an interview with Time Magazine. Most of her friends evacuated in the middle of the night with only the pajamas they were in. “I envisioned my own bedroom and I was thinking about how my clothes, makeup, and shoes—everything—is my identity and it's my sense of self. And it's the same thing for all of my friends and all these girls who lost everything in the fire.” Colvert wanted her friends to be able to feel normal again. “I was like, okay, Pasadena Civic Center has the necessities, but I want specific items for these girls so they can feel like themselves again and get their confidence back,” she says.

Avery organized donation drives, collecting essential supplies like food, clothing, and hygiene products but also items like makeup, clothes reflecting current teen trends, and other cherished teen memorabilia that many lost in the fires.

Avery is yet another example of how girls, no matter their age, can spark change and create a lasting impact. Support Avery's movement at the link in our bio.",1.10361E+14,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFGN1_ApmXP/,2025-01-21 18:08:08+00:00

"We are so grateful to be home again thanks to the @losangelesfiredepartment ❤️

Here are some scenes from our evacuation story…

We first left our house voluntarily to escape the smoke & aircraft noise from the Palisades Fire. We were lucky enough to be able to stay at my sister in law’s home in Paso Robles 3 hours north of LA. 

After we arrived in Paso, we received an official evacuation warning notice for our street— we had left a lot of important things & my car , so we drove BACK to LA to pack more. We were extremely lucky to have the time to do this.

Some of the items I wanted to pack are funny. On one list of things to take “nut bag” was number 1  (we make our own almond milk). Also, a hand painted leopard blazer with Motley Crue’s portraits, leather shorts & eargasm concert ear plugs made the list. Obviously the rock necessities make me laugh, but it’s what I wanted to save in that moment of chaos and panic …I also took a painting my mother made and Andy’s grandmother’s art so I wasn’t completely irrational… I only regretted not grabbing my guitar pick collection.

But, truly ALL I ever needed was always in the front seat of our car next to me the entire time❤️

"Two weeks in…
.
Last night, as I laid in a bed that wasn’t mine, curled in sheets that felt foreign to me, clad in clothes that were previously owned by someone else, I once again attempted in vain to sleep (those twilight escapes don’t really come anymore). Instead my mind was racing that today marks the two week point. Two weeks, 14 days, since everything that was my “normal”, everything that I considered “home”, disappeared. I can’t speak for my other fellow fire victims (God I hate that word, victim, but it’s what people are using, and sadly pretty accurate), but when you’re lying there at night, with nothing but the darkness and sounds of a neighborhood you aren’t familiar with, THAT’S when it hits the hardest. This isn’t some kind of extended vacation. The reality punches you that this change is permanent. It’s daunting. So as I laid there stewing in my emotions and pondering how things feel at this two week mark, one thing kept sticking in my brain…
.
The people of the Palisades are fighters.
.
Disaster victims are usually divided into two categories. Ones that are completely frozen with the enormity of what to do, and the unsurety of what lies ahead (honestly, can you blame them?) And ones that fall right into the “GSD” (or “get shit done”) category. The fighters. It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that the people of the Palisades fall mostly in that latter category. Most of us worked so damn hard our entire lives, and busted our asses in ways that are sometimes incomprehensible for decades, to EARN the ability to call the Palisades home. Nothing was handed out to us. And that wiring is still within us. We will still fight, and work, and bust our asses all over again, and do whatever it takes to rediscover even 10% of a semblance of what we lost.
.
The Palisades was, and will be again, filled with fighters.
.
We got knocked down. HARD. And we may still have to lie on the mat until the count of 9 to gather ourselves, but we WILL get back up, fists up, ready to fight again. Because here at the two week mark, that’s the thought that has hit me the most…
.
We are fighters. And the Palisades WILL rise again.

"Amid the chaos of the Los Angeles fires, one story stood out: the bravery of the “inmate firefighters” that make up 30% of the firefighters in California.  Social media and news outlets erupted in applause—and rightfully so. These men risked their lives to save homes and lives for about a dollar an hour. ‍

But as the smoke clears, a harsh truth emerges: these same men—praised for their heroism—will soon face rejection. They’ll struggle to find jobs, housing, or basic acceptance in the very communities they just helped protect. 

If we, as a society, can celebrate someone’s redemption in a moment of crisis, why can’t we extend that same grace and opportunity once the crisis is over? The same voices applauding them today will deny them tomorrow. The same networks praising them now will vilify them later. 

As a business owner (www.saywt.com) and ministry founder (brand316.org), I challenge you: extend the second chances you’ve been given in life to others. ✅ When hiring, look beyond someone’s record and see the whole person. As a landlord, consider their humanity before dismissing them. As a fellow human being, remember they are someone’s son, daughter, father, or mother. 

We all make mistakes. We all need second chances. Let your first assumption be that they are one of the firefighters  who saved a community. Everyone deserves the chance to rewrite their story. ✍️ 

Most business owners and landlords (including myself) that have taken this chance have realized it was well worth it.  People with records tend to be better employees, more appreciative of the chance you extended and more loyal to your company.

"It is with deep sadness that I learn of the loss of one of the first homes I worked on as a young architect, during my time at @uscarchitecture. Though my role was very minor and largely administrative, the Descending Courtyard House—perched on a bluff in Pacific Palisades—inspired me and left a lasting impression. Designed with love by Ric Abramson, FAIA, it was a striking example of architectural confidence, with its robust form and sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. The use of board-formed concrete, both in its aesthetic and its material honesty, would later inspire our own work on the Two Angle House.

The home’s construction, consisting almost entirely of concrete, steel, and glass, vividly demonstrates the power and destruction of the Palisades fires. It stands in stark contrast to the media narrative suggesting that the fire was the result of cheap building practices; in this instance, no design or material choices, however thoughtful, could have withstood such a forceful blaze.

The loss of this home is yet another reminder of the fragility of our most cherished architectural achievements. My thoughts are with Ric, his clients, and all those who found meaning in the house’s bold, dignified presence.",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFGdgF1z3dL/,2025-01-21 20:24:54+00:00

"Fires burn in Los Angeles. From oceans and canyons to mountains and valleys. Kinship Circle soon departs for animal rescue in the Palisades area. We’ve helped coordinate aid remotely for a few weeks now. 

Despite windblown flames, animals survive. They hide, terrified and alone, in wreckage. Cats, especially, stay in charred homes to wait for their families. Access is tricky, with residents and animal orgs still denied entry in some evacuated communities. But rescuers won’t give up and continue to work with authorities. There’s a link in our bio to a recent news story.

The STRIPED CAT in photo was recently trapped in a Pacific Palisades, CA neighborhood where all residents evacuated.

I created these slides with @resiliencealliance. They’re full of helpful tips on how to deal with all the toxic ash, especially if you’re in/near a burn zone. We have so much ash on our porch, cars, roof, just everywhere. I’m glad I saw this information before we attempted to clean it up.

"When the LA County wildfires ignited on January 7, 2025, I know I wasn’t alone in feeling that overwhelming urge to help, yet almost feeling helpless at the same time. What can I possibly do to make a difference in the face of such devastation? … They need nutritious, fueling meals while fighting these fires for days and WEEKS at a time. What can I do to ease the burden for those who lost EVERYTHING? At least feed them.

Over 1,000 healthy meals were prepped and hand-delivered to over 40 fire stations, police departments, state troopers, and shelters for displaced residents affected by the Los Angeles wildfires.

I’m beyond grateful to the hardworking front-liners who continue to protect and serve us, and to the incredible LA community for coming together in the face of tragedy. 

Thanks to the generosity of hundreds of individuals who donated. Your kindness and support made this possible.

This is why I started B Fit Meals—to help others when it matters most. As LA rebuilds, we’re committed to fundraising weekly meals to support families in need. This is just the beginning.

My thoughts and prayers are with all those impacted by this national disaster. Stay strong, LA

"️❄️ ¡TORMENTA INVERNAL EN CAMINO! — Este próximo fin de semana podríamos registrar la primera tormenta invernal significativa en el sur de California. 

Este Martes 21 de Enero, 2025, la probabilidad se mantiene por debajo de un 40%, así que la proyección preliminar podría cambiar.

Sin embargo, la mayoría de modelos meteorológicos coinciden que tendremos ambiente invernal en la región tras el descenso de un sistema de baja presión desde Canadá, el cual provocará un desplome notorio en las temperaturas máximas, aire ártico, y potencialmente descargas de precipitación ligera, tanto líquida como sólida, de manera generalizada. 

¿Cuando?
Las precipitaciones comenzarían el Sábado 4:00 AM extendiéndose hasta el lunes por la madrugada.

¿Potencia de tormenta?
Débil en naturaleza. Acumulados de lluvia menos de 0.50” pulgadas y solamente trazas de nieve.

¿Beneficio?
Las lloviznas ayudarán con la contención de los incendios #palisadesfire #eatonfire así como combatir la sequía que nuevamente enfrenta el estado.

Desde que inició la temporada de lluvias, el pasado 1.ro de Octubre, el centro de Los Ángeles solamente ha registrado una acumulación de lluvia de 0.16”, contar con una acumulación de lluvia de 3.99” así que el déficit es de -3.83”. 

Estaré pendiente!

"The last two weeks have been some of the toughest of my life—losing my home, navigating where to live, and trying to keep it all together as a business owner, husband, and soon-to-be dad. I’ve felt everything from shock and grief to deep gratitude and hope.

It’s strange how loss can make you reflect on what really matters. I’m learning to let go of the material things and focus on the people and moments that bring true meaning to my life. This whole experience reminds me that none of us are alone—we lean on our communities, and we give back when and how we can.

I’m still decompressing, and I’ll admit, I feel lost at times. But I know this is temporary, and we’ll rebuild stronger than ever. I’m incredibly grateful for my wife, my family, my community, and everyone who has shown us love and support.

Thank you for walking with me through this journey. Let’s keep finding hope in every moment, and in each other.  #californiawildfires #palisades #palisadesfire #chefsofcalifornia",212999109,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFGuv2IyEID/,2025-01-21 22:55:36+00:00

"“Last night at the Rose Bowl, I met with members of the Pine Grove firefighting team that have battled the Eaton and Palisades fires. These firefighters are 18-28 years old, have been convicted of serious or violent crimes, when not fighting fires are serving their time at the Pine Grove fire camp in Amador County, CA, and are true heroes. Through hard work, discipline and grit, they are transforming their lives from ones that took from and hurt their community to ones that better it. We need to clone Pine Grove to offer this chance for transformation to as many young people as possible in the juvenile justice system.” -DA Hochman

"The Great Tribulation Is Approaching: It’s Dangerous to Stay Asleep
We have seen wars, earthquakes, floods, and extreme weather—all signs of the Lord’s return. However, it is concerning that many people remain asleep, focused on material pleasures and personal lives, while ignoring God’s call and the message of Christ’s return. Jesus warned, “So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth “ (Revelation 3:16).
When Jesus returns, those who are asleep will be cast aside, while those who stay alert and ready to welcome Him will be taken into the kingdom of heaven.
Are you among those who are awake and prepared for the Lord’s return? Come join our WhatsApp group to learn the truth about His coming and how to be reunited with Him.

"HELP LAPP ARTIST RED-TAIL AND THE LOLLIE FAMILY THRIVE AFTER THE EATON FIRE. 

Red-tail is an Indigenous dancer, ritualist, and longtime member of the LAPP artist community. They are emblematic of the artists from our programs, beginning with dance residencies as part of our RESEARCH + DEVELOPMENT (R+D) program in 2017 and 2021,  followed by “Dance for the Hawks: Observing & Dancing in Nature,” an LAPP WORKSHOP they led. Most recently, Red-tail participated in our ACCELERATOR program to resource an ensemble dance performance at REDCAT.

In January of 2025, Red-tail’s Altadena family lost their home and all their belongings in the Eaton fire. They are now facing the enormous challenge of rebuilding their lives, while Red-tail is also currently recovering from breast cancer surgery. Our hearts are with the Lollie family, and we encourage you to donate to their GoFundMe, send gift cards as requested, and share their story with those who may be able to help.

All members of our LAPP community who are facing hardships as a result of the January 2025 wildfires are invited to fill out the Artist Survey linked in our bio, with which we are gathering information to fill in gaps in artist relief and support. Please forward your GoFundMe links so we can share to our stories, and don’t hesitate to reach out to let us know how else we can help.

"From the open hills of the 1920s to the vibrant community we know and love today, the Palisades has always been special.

What’s happened in the last couple of weeks has forever changed our home, neighborhoods, schools, restaurants, and shops, but our strength as a community remains unshaken. 
Together, we’ll rebuild and come back stronger than ever.

This is our home, and we’re here for each other, always!

"As I aimlessly wandered through the streets filled with remnants of people's homes, I found myself wondering about those who have just found themselves in unimaginable situations.  I looked for something, anything that was identifiable. And most of the time, I couldn't find a single item. Nothing but ash. 

When I was able to find something, I discovered that one person loves the color yellow - especially lemons. Another is extremely whimsical and loves fantastical creatures. Another is devout. Another absolutely loves animals.

Every single one of these homes you see in the vast landscape of destruction represents lives forever changed... it's very easy to become numb to it, oftentimes as a coping mechanism.  At one point, I even felt myself becoming unable to cry any more. 

But, in the eerie silence of the evacuation zones, these are all small moments that gave me pause - stirring up emotion and serving as a reminder that there is a person to whom these objects matter, and will most likely serve as one of the only memories that remain from what they've lost.

"I am so grateful and relieved to share that the Palisades fire is now 63% contained and the Eaton fire is 89% contained. I want to extend my deepest thanks to the courageous firefighters, first responders, volunteers and shelters who are working tirelessly to help Los Angeles. My heart aches for those who have lost their homes, their memories and their sense of safety. The devastation is unimaginable. Seeing the love, care and unity within this city has been such a beautiful thing to witness.

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who has reached out to check on me. Your love and thoughtfulness means more than words can express. Things got scary during the evacuation as we seen the fires closing in (next slide). In that moment of panic, I was unsure of what to do, just praying for guidance. Right before getting on the freeway to San Diego, a friend I will cherish forever offered a safe place for me, my friend and our dogs. I give God all the glory for His protection and for placing such amazing people in my life.❤️❤️

In times of uncertainty, finding small moments to be grateful for can be our greatest strength. As I look at this photo of Muffie and I, taken on January 1st, 2025, I’m reminded of the love, hope and peace we can still cling to even in challenging times. My smile reflects the gratitude I feel for what truly matters - the gift of life. This past week has been emotionally overwhelming but it’s important to try staying positive and remain faithful. Trust and believe that brighter days are ahead for all of us.

To those of you impacted by the wildfires, please know you’re in my thoughts and prayers. Let’s continue to lean into each other, offering support however we can and trust that together, we will rebuild a stronger Los Angeles. Please look below for resources and various ways you can help.",212999109,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFG49s3Sd1U/,2025-01-22 00:24:52+00:00
"As the ashes waft over the salted sea, the dolphins bond together. Searching for smiles in this time of grief, we in Los Angeles, must be like them and stand by our community. We must never give up our love of life and ability to support each other.

"The kids volunteered for the evacuated horses at @thelaec last Sunday. Since all of the usual tasks of feeding, cleaning, watering, and walking were all taken care of, they were given their bracelets and tasked with the simple, but important task of “comforting and loving” the horses. Something they did naturally. It was so beautiful to see the horses light up with curiosity in their presence, and as soon as we got in the car, each kid knew the name of the horse they fell in love with. That is the magic of horses. They are reflective and the love and comfort is always reciprocated.  

There are still over 120 evacuated horses at LAEC, with more coming in as other evacuation sites shut down. 

The amazing volunteers are tiring and having to return to other life’s responsibilities. If you are able to help and volunteer, please do. 

Thank you to my dear friend @carlajobailey for giving so much.

"10 days ago, I began volunteering daily at @Animalwellnessfoundation. My head is still spinning from all the events that have transpired, all the animals who have touched my life, and incredible humans who have renewed my faith in humanity. For every sad story, I have 3 happy ones. @dr.annieharvilicz has become my hero, opening her clinic for FREE emergency veterinary care and boarding for displaced animals. I’m still in awe of every person who has walked through fire, crawled through rubble, and sneaked over, under, or past a fence and the National Guard in order to save someone’s pet…because pets are family. These photos capture only a fraction of the animals who’ve passed through or are being cared for in the clinic, including 40 dogs, a dozen cats, multiple turtles, tortoises, cockatiels, parrots, chinchillas and 10 chickens. One chicken jumped onto my shoulder when I tried to leave after defending her from being pecked. Animals are so much smarter than we think, and apart from swimming with whales, nothing makes me happier ❤️

"“I like to make public sculptures in which people can participate, that have a functional purpose as well as an esthetic one.” ￼

- Tony Rosenthal, renowned American abstract sculptor, original designer and original owner of The Day House

Artist Tony Rosenthal’s home, which later became The Day House after my grandparents, Jan and Frank Day, purchased it in the 1960’s, was more than a residence—it was his greatest masterpiece. It fulfilled his ultimate wish as an artist: to create a space where people could come together, participate, and dream. My grandparents Jan and Frank, through @jafracosmetics , made this home a place where thousands found inspiration and transformed their lives. After they passed away in the 90’s, I continued this tradition and it became a place where artists, dreamers, and friends imagined ideas, made their dreams come true, created films, and different forms of iconic art, and all the rest….until it burned down in The Palisades Fire on January 7, 2025.

We honor my grandparents, and Rosenthal’s legacy, by committing to rebuild a beautiful home where people can continue to gather, celebrate life, and embrace their dreams ❤️

The first two photos capture a moment with my dear friend, whose home also burned down, as we discuss ways to rebuild stronger, better, and more beautifully than ever before, next to the iconic fireplace still standing after the Palisades Fire. The last two photos show Tony Rosenthal himself—first after his original home burned down in 1956, and later that same year, standing proudly beside the new house he built. Here’s to hoping we can channel Tony’s resilience and speed (and so can the @cityofmalibu @cityoflosangeles ) and rebuild just as quickly, or close to it ❤️

"I’m happy to share this *UPDATE* from my sister, Brooke:

“Priya and I are humbled by the outpouring of love and support from those we know and others in our community and beyond who have cared for us during this unbelievable event. I found a new home for us so we may recover and rebuild our strength. I am now looking for schools for Priya to attend. 

This event impacted us on so many levels as I work in the community like so many others and deeply feel the resonating impacts to systems that lifted and supported us. Priya’s friend group has scattered to areas around Los Angeles and outside Los Angeles. We were tightly knit in the beautiful haven which is the Pacific Palisades, but now we are learning we have close friends and family everywhere. A home is a living, breathing being and the loss is indescribable. Your help has meant everything to us and fills our hearts.”

"This Black & White Wednesday chronicles the week of January 6, 2025. Monday started out a normal mundane week, working out of our L.A. offices. By Wednesday morning my colleagues and I were giving strict instructions to work from home due to dangerous winds and brush fires. By Friday morning, one of California’s biggest fires was fully ablaze. These photos were taken throughout that week and as recent at January 19, 2025. Showing the first days of the Palisades fires and the aftermath of the Eaton fires. I took these on my Minolta SRT101 35mm film camera. I used my Soligor 135mm f/3.5 and Minolta MD 50mm f/1.7 lenses. Shot on Kenmore Pan100 film.

.
.
 P100 respirator with OV/AG filter (removes 99.97% of particulates larger than 0.3 microns, plus SOME VOCs)
 Durable safety goggles that can stop dust from contacting your eyes
 Long-cuffed leather work gloves (kevlar works too)

"Part 1/2. I’m finally back in AZ after living in Los Angeles for the last two weeks. It was complete coincidence that we were there for the fires as I tagged along with @annelisecherie on a work trip. I was also planning to spend some time exploring the city for the first time and doing some filming of various scenes for one of my projects. Literally the 1st or 2nd day after we got there, fires all broke out across the city and completely flipped the trip upside down. We were staying in an area that was under lvl2 evac warning so essentially we were on standby evacuation. Bags packed, waiting at the door to run out at a moments notice. A fire popped up within a half mile of us as well but luckily was put out quickly thanks to the @losangelesfiredepartment 
.
Being that I had brought almost my entire set of filming equipment, I knew I had to document what I could, in the way I know how. It sometimes feels helpless as a videographer/photographer while there’s so much chaos (especially knowing I have a fully capable rig sitting at home), but documenting and sharing the experience is incredibly important in these types of situations and turns out there are moments that you actually are able to help. In our case we were able to help give a guy a ride out of the Palisades area, and we also spent some time volunteering at a donation collection facility for those who lost everything. 
.
The air was so toxic during the fires, like nothing I’ve experienced before. Ash was falling from the sky even down at Santa Monica Pier and the sky had the most ominous look to it ever, especially at sunset. 
.
My heart goes out to the people that lost their homes, every day we were there it seemed we found out about someone new that lost their house. 
.
I took the last couple weeks off of here to just kind of deal with the situation at hand while there and leave time for processing. I really couldn’t even decide if I wanted to share these things more, but at the end of the day I think it’s important. So with that being said here’s a few photos of some scenes encountered and I’ll be posting Part 2 tomorrow with raw video of the experience. Stay safe friends

"A Heartfelt Thank You from Ms. Romero's 3rd Grade Class  

We were so touched to receive a beautiful thank-you poster from Ms. Romero's 3rd Grade Class at @ileadaguadulce! The children created the poster to express their gratitude to all the first responders who worked tirelessly on the #eatonfire and #palisadesfire. Along with the poster came some delicious cookies—thank you!  

Since the poster came to us through one of our employees whose child is in the class, we wanted to make sure it reached as many first responders as possible. We brought it to the Incident Command Post at the Eaton Fire, where our colleagues returned the favor by signing a map of the Eaton Fire area for the kids. 

From there, the poster traveled to @lacountyfd Fire Station 11 in Altadena, @aldlasd, @altadenamountainrescue, Fire Station 82 in La Canada Flintridge, and finally, our station. Each stop brought more signatures and heartfelt appreciation for the class’s thoughtfulness. 

Thank you, Ms. Romero's class, for your kind words and support. It means the world to us, and we hope you enjoy the signed map as a token of our gratitude! ‍ #thankyou #CommunitySupport #firstresponders #lasd",812348069,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFI2YOfSMlZ/,2025-01-22 18:40:45+00:00
"Palisades fire part 1  January 6th began like most days I got up got Ruby ready for school walked our dog then worked out. I went out to my car as I had an appointment as I walked out i smelt smoke I looked up and saw red flames on the nearby mountain. This fire was very close to our home but we trusted that the firefighters would put it out. As I drove to my appointment I felt uneasy like I should turn around and come home so I did. By the time I was heading back there was traffic everywhere & people already evacuating. I called my hubby to go pick up Ruby from school as it was right near the fire. When he went to pick her up all her friends were crying and begged him to take them with him. I made it home kids arrived and were all crying. We tried to comfort them whilst we tried to pack up our cars with belongings from our safe, certain jewelry pieces and some clothes. One by one Rubys friends got picked up. The last one to get picked up her dad had to abandon his car as run to our home as the traffic was too crazy. I tried to hose our home as best I could and we locked up and drove toward Santa Monica. We could have never imagined that would be the last time we would see our home or neighborhood a friend who was in Australia at the time offered their beautiful home for us to stay in Venice beach so we went there.  We were glued to the news & fire watch app to see what was happening with the fire…

"Palisades Fire part 3  The next few days I could barely think straight I felt paralyzed, but the only thing I knew I could do was try to set the kids up with some new clothes. So I focused on getting them the basics to make them feel a little bit happy. On Thursday my family & I felt strongly that we needed to go up to our Neighbourhood on E bikes to see it for ourselves we felt like we had to see it to believe it really happened and it wasn’t just a nightmareSo we rented some E bikes and went up there to see the devastation. It was extremely hard and completely heartbreaking  We did not last very long as there was a house nearby that was on fire, but we did manage to see a few things that were left in the fire, my son‘s beloved basketball hoop, our ping-pong table, couple of pots and our Buddha sitting there peacefully. We did not touch anything as we did not have the appropriate clothes so we just headed back down the beach path to drop off the bikes. When we are allowed back in our Neighbourhood myself along with a few of my neighbors are going to go back to our street in hazmat suits gloves, goggles, boots mask, and I am determined to find something in the rubble that we can take with us ❤️‍

"Palisades Fire part 4 ❤️‍Through this most challenging time just over two weeks later, the thing that has been keeping my family and I going is our love for each other and our incredible family, friends and community. The generosity that has been showed to us has given us hope in humanity. From our friends starting a GoFundMe page and all the people who have donated funds for us to incredibly generous friends who offered their beautiful home to us and told us we can stay here as long as we need, to people stopping by or sending clothes, packages, skin care, shoes, to the phone calls, texts, the messages on social media the kind restaurants that have offered our family free meals to the incredible companies offering free clothes, shoes and skincare This kindness and generosity has been giving our family hope❤️‍

Living in the Pacific Palisades for almost 11 years was such an incredible chapter for us. Our daughter was born in our home. The Palisades was a jewel and so special ✨Amongst the mountains but so close to the beach. I will miss our incredible neighbors and neighborhood but we have the memories and will cherish them forever ❤️‍

My family and I do not know where our next chapter will take us. We are starting over and where that will be is a mystery for now. We are trusting the universal will provide the answers for us as we navigate this time. 

Thank you to everybody who has reached out and supported. We love you all and we’re so grateful for you 

From the ashes we will rise and we will rebuild❤️‍

"Pt. 6 - 1/15 As you can see the other 300 meals prepped and boxed up on the 5th slide, thanks to @annielcampbell & her team, We were able to get those delivered to the Emergency Operations Center (different from Bureau). 
Again, the constant gratitude and appreciation from those receiving these meals.. I had gone back the following day to drop more & the response from just a few of the officers that had the meal, “wow, they were soo delicious!!” 
They went on to say how helpful it has been for them to be receiving all these meals.. 

It’s been amazing to see everyone coming together in all different aspects to help in whichever way possible..
And a thank you to @davidbzand for pulling through extremely last minute to help make this delivery/drop happen

Not only did we deliver meals, we also put out a fire on the way back!!‍‍♂️
Yes, it may look small in the video, but was bigger as I was driving by before I made a U-turn. And yes, it may have been for a homeless for warmth, BUT THESE ARE HOW THE COUNTLESS BUILDING/STRUCTURE FIRES START IN DOWNTOWN!! IT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED!!

I wasn’t allowed to take any photos/videos in the command center at the Bureau, but they allowed us to here! What a sight, seeing many different departments & agencies working together, working 12+ hr shifts, all day and all night.

"If you or anyone you know was affected by the wildfires, please share this. Our home was in Altadena on Altadena Dr and my friend/coworker was right around the corner, his home complete ash. We were right in the thick of it and the first thing they tell us to do is get a mailbox for insurance and benefits, etc. They are not cheap and it’s another thing to add to our plates. This could be really helpful for a lot of people.

This location is also doing free faxing, scanning/emailing, and computer rental for wildfire victims.

"Rain is forecast in LA for this weekend. We desperately need it. But with rain, comes other risks. The toxic debris from the fires will be washed into the oceans - there's a public safety warning not to swim at any LA beaches.
Then...there's the landslides. When there's been a massive burn, the landscape is left barren of trees, which are what keeps soil rooted in place. The soil that's left is weakened, and can be easily washed away.
The area that I lived in, the Palisades, was mountainous - the village sat at the foot of the Santa Monica Mountains, whilst other homes nestled in the mountains themselves...
I'm awaiting the rain with a mix of relief and trepidation, and hoping that we won't be hit with another extreme weather event.

"Esquina Bicycle Shop continues to work tirelessly to sustain itself during these tough times, navigating the economic impact of the LA fires. Despite averaging just $0-$30 a day, we remain committed to taking donations and supporting fire relief efforts.

Today, we received an incredible in-kind donation from @luminaid , who generously provided hundreds of solar-powered lanterns and phone chargers to help those affected by the fires. These lanterns are lightweight, waterproof, and collapsible, making them perfect for emergencies. They charge during the day using solar power and provide hours of bright light at night, with a built-in phone charger to help people stay connected when it matters most.

These invaluable tools will bring light and connection to our community and are heading straight to the front lines in Altadena, where residents are beginning to repopulate and clean up after the devastation.

We’re deeply grateful for this support as we continue to stand together during this challenging time.

Thank you so much @luminaid !! ❤️‍

"I’d love to share some pictures from the areas that’ve been affected by the giant fires.

My heart goes to the people suffered in LA. 

My friends and many of those I know, have lost their homes and land keeping years or even generations of effort, work.

Even though I didn’t have any belongings in the fire, I feel the loss of the dearest places in the city I love, turned to ashes many at once.

The places I could see myself living, eventually. - The hills and forests where I used to hold ceremonies, events, healing circles. Replenish myself. 

It took me to the memories of the places I no longer can see in Russia and Ukraine: some destroyed or full of mines (for years ahead), while others unsafe to go for political reasons.

Definitely went through a complex process of accepting how it is, levels of helplessness close to those when the war began, and now it’s “normal”. We adapt and keep going. 
Focus on creation.

They would run around the house yelling, “vote for Rick Caruso.”  When we got the house in Malibu, I found out that Rick had a house down the road from us. Every time we passed his house the kids would be so excited at the chance to meet him. Well one day we did. For the kids, he is the biggest celebrity. They were so star struck when they finally met him that they were quiet . Rick was so kind, classy and debonair. He spent a good amount of time chatting with us. Unfortunately he lost his house as well and it will be many years before our community will be rebuilt again and we are sad for the people that will decide not to come back.

"The Hughes Fire erupted in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, with the blaze coming at the same time that county officials are battling the Palisades and Eaton Fires, both of which started on January 7.

The Hughes Fire, just like the ones that ignited before it, exploded in size in the high winds of Southern California, spreading to more than 5,000 acres in just two hours after it was first reported near Castaic Lake.

The Palisades Fire, which has burned more than 23,400 acres, remains at less than 70% containment, while the Eaton Fire, which has burned just over 14,000 acres, is just over 90% contained, according to Cal Fire.

If the FAIR Plan is unable to pay all of its claims, virtually every insured homeowner in the state could end up paying a portion of the LA County fire losses.

"SAVED: Paul R. Williams’ Theobald House, 1930. This charming and casual California colonial survived the Palisades fire. Better yet, it still has the charming dovecote atop the garage. 

Paul Revere Williams, a trailblazing black architect, was born in LA in 1894 and orphaned at four. Despite being told by a high school guidance counselor that he shouldn’t become an architect because “black people couldn’t afford him,” he persevered to become the first licensed African-American architect west of the Mississippi. 

He taught himself to draw upside down so that his white clients wouldn’t feel uncomfortable sitting next to him. He became the architect to the stars,” designing houses for the likes of Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball despite the fact that he was not allowed to live in the neighborhoods where he designed gracious homes. 

He shaped LA with over 3,000 buildings ranging from the Beverly Hills Hotel (whose logo is his handwriting) to the LA County Courthouse to affordable housing projects. He passed away in 1980, but in 2017 was posthumously awarded the American Institute of Architect’s highest award, the AIA Gold Medal, cementing him as one of the greatest architects of the twentieth century.

"If you’ve lost your home in the Los Angeles Fires then you definitely feel like you are stuck in Edvard Munch’s The Scream 1893 painting. This painting is part of Munch’s semi-autobiographical Frieze of Life series, which explores themes of love, death, and angst. However, I decided to flip the switch at the @mrbrainwashartmuseum and paint my own version of this painting. This truly depicts where I’m at after my home burned down. I feel like I’m living in a dream and a nightmare all at the same time. Along with the anxiety and angst which is what this painting usually represents, I also feel excitement looking forward into the future, blessed for the present, and a knowing that what’s in the past, should be left behind. 

One of my favorite quotes in Latin and the only thing I learned in my two years of taking Latin in high school:

“Carpe diem quam minimum credula postero”

Seize the day trusting in the future as little as possible…

"This photo captures a cherished moment with my family at our beloved park in Pacific Palisades, a community where we’ve lived and loved for over 18 years. My husband and I built our family here, creating a home and connections that have been deeply meaningful to us.

The Palisades fire has stripped away our physical home, our children’s schools, and separated us from our neighbors, friends, and familiar local spaces. During this devastating period, I’ve been drawing strength from two fundamental life skills: resilience and positivity.

In my book, “Common Wisdom,” I explore how resilience can transform our perspective on challenges. I firmly believe that life’s most difficult moments happen for us, not to us—even when the purpose seems obscure. This belief serves as my anchor, helping me choose faith over fear and trust that uncertainty can hold unexpected growth and opportunities.

Practicing positivity allows me to recognize and appreciate small blessings: the unwavering support of loved ones, the quiet beauty of a sunset, or the inner strength that propels me forward. 

While my heart has been profoundly wounded, the most healing aspect of this experience has been the overwhelming love, support, generosity, and kindness extended to me by both those closest to me and complete strangers.

I hope these reflections and Common Wisdom skills can help you and anyone who has been through an unexpected life event. They are really helping me, and I am sharing to help anyone else impacted.

I realize that even though this is such a devastating situation, we can all only wallow in the sadness for so long. That’s why I decided to bring in an expert. Paulo may be tiny in stature, but he’s massive in strength. Paulo is a skilled E.S.H. (Emotional Support Hamster) who somehow survived the fires and is now stationed with me. He’ll be assisting me with this whole “rebuilding a life” process. It won’t be easy, but with Paulo by my side, I feel a touch more confident.

Keep an eye out for Paulo as we go through this together. He is wise and I bow to his wisdom. Although Floyd isn’t quite sure about him yet, I know he’ll come around.

Thanks to YOUR incredible generosity, we’ve been able to provide critical equipment, food, and resources to help these firefighters on the frontlines. The photos in this post are from one of the brave firefighters we’ve been fortunate to support—a reminder of the challenges they face daily to keep us safe. Here he is fighting the Hughes Fire in Castaic. This is after more than a week of battling the Palisades Fire. 

Our first responders have been working around the clock, many sleeping in tents or motels far from their families and loved ones. Their sacrifice and dedication to protecting our communities is nothing short of heroic.

This is a long road to recovery, but we must continue to rally around these heroes. Let’s keep the momentum going and show them that we’re with them every step of the way.

"A Beacon of Resilience ✨ Amid the devastation of the Pacific Palisades wildfire, this remarkable home stood as a testament to the power of thoughtful design and fire-safe construction. Designed by architect Greg Chasen, it weathered the flames with materials and strategies built for resilience. 

Here’s how it withstood the flames:

✅ Fire-Safe Materials
*  Solid concrete walls blocked flames and provided a strong foundation.
* ️ A metal roof with fire-resistant underlayment stopped embers from penetrating.
*  Tempered glass windows didn’t shatter under extreme heat, keeping fire and smoke out.
*  Defensible space: No vegetation near the house + concrete garden walls.

✅ Smart Design
*  No eaves, overhangs, or attic vents that could let sparks in.
*  Airtight construction stopped embers from sneaking inside.
* ️ Special ventilation systems filtered out smoke, keeping the air safe to breathe.

This home shows what’s possible with thoughtful home design and a focus on resilience. It’s also inspired me on my own journey to build a wildfire-resilient, solar-powered home in San Diego. ☀️

Yesterday I met with a family in LA who lost their home and their entire community of Altadena in the wildfires. Their kids school burned down as well  They want to build a climate-resilient home that is wildfire-safe and net-zero energy. We also hope to help the entire community build back more resilient. 

 Follow @californiahomedesigns for more tips on wildfire-resilient design, sustainable building strategies, and creating safer, stronger homes!

"Dear Community of Los Angeles,

You may know my wife and I in person but if you don’t, my wife and I are builders and we have renovated and build homes in Los Angeles for years. Right now we are stepping back and writing to you not as general contractors but as your neighbors and residents of the same city who are absolutely heartbroken for our community. 

Our hearts go out to our beloved cities of Altadena, Pacific Palisades and everyone affected during these tragic times. We’ve been working behind the scenes, assisting in any way we can, but it’s time to put our expertise to use. 

Rebuilding the cities of Altadena and Pacific Palisades won’t be an easy task and for many it will be the first time building something from ground up, as well as, dealing with insurance companies. Please do not rush into anything and talk to experts. We would love to help you and your families make rebuilding process as worry free as possible and offer some major discounts to help during this tragedy. Our goal is to provide any assistance whether it be discounts, working with insurance, simply answering questions or anything else our community may need when rebuilding. 

We also want to warn the community about possible price gouging and scams that might take place and we are keeping our lines open for any questions. If something seems off please double check with another credible source and don’t get scammed by any unlicensed or untrustworthy “contractors”. When in doubt - reach out. 

If you or someone you know, needs assistance, please reach out. My wife and I are here for you. 

We are with you, Altadena! 

We are with you, Pacific Palisades!

We are with you, Los Angeles! Together we can rebuild and restore

"The day after the Palisades Malibu burned, while metal was still smoldering, ash fell like snow, and the air filled with the hellish smell of char, I decided to ride my bicycle out my door to see what had happened. The previous forty-eight hours had been riddled with anxiety, no sleep, and a plan of action if the fire moved another mile north to the shop. We put out small fires with garden hoses, moved cars around, and packed out our most valued things (mostly photos). This wasn’t new - just a month ago we all spent forty-eight hours with a garden hose battling the Franklin Fires a stones throw away from our front doors. Who would have thought that the Franklin fire is what saved us from the Palisades one. 

The Palisades decimated the coast line, gnawed off the hillside homes, and took no mercy on those who have lived here fifty years or six months. This fire was furious, with hurricane winds and the might of Zeus, there was no stopping this, nothing. Whatever stood in its way had better accept its fate. Tears rolled down my face as I bicycled the coast. Friends that are as close as family had lost their homes, strangers I’m sure I’ve eaten next to a million time that surely we wouldn’t be eating together again for a long time, life in Malibu will never be the same.

"In the wake of the devastating Los Angeles fires and the aftermath of the 2024 election, our city and nation are grappling with profound loss and uncertainty. As people navigate displacement, fear, and exhaustion, many are experiencing a deep sense of grief and anxiety. This session will offer space to reflect on the emotional toll of these events and explore ways we can foster resilience and hope within our communities. Together, we’ll discuss the complex mix of emotions—from frustration and anxiety to determination and a call to action—and consider how we can process these feelings in ways that lead to meaningful engagement and support.

"The Los Angeles wildfires have left behind unimaginable devastation, reducing homes and memories to ashes. Families have lost everything, and communities are grappling with grief and trying to rebuild.

We invite you to stand in prayer with us for those affected. Pray for comfort for the grieving, strength for the displaced, and hope for those starting over.

As the Body of Christ, let us also be the hands and feet of Jesus, extending love and support wherever we can.

 “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.” - Psalm 34:18

 “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.” - Galatians 6:2

"As the fire broke out I found myself driving straight towards it ️ I ended up a couple thousand feet from the mandatory evacuation zone, and was able to help a family friend by evacuation her one of a kind art collection. 
 When I returned a second time, the fire was much closer, not that you could tell.  when you’re in the thick of it the reality is you’re just in a giant cloud of smoke and don’t really know what’s going on.  
Just then I ran over a nail some careless workers left in the road and I heard the unwelcoming but familiar sound of air hissing out of my tire. 
Dammit! I showed up to help and was now a sitting duck. 
Wait, who took the jack out of my truck?!
City Services Were swamped; fortunately my neighbor owns a tow truck company, and I was able to convince my roommate @sierraskywalker to grab a giant jack from them and meet me in Brentwood… 
…So in the end outside of some smoke inhalation and a bit of stress, I think I was able to do some good that day. 

There is still much much more to be done… and I’m leaning ever closer to considering taking a break from art to become a wildfirefighter ‍ 

I don’t have words for those who lost everything - I only know that there never has a situation been so bad, that something good hasn’t come from it.

Thank You To Everyone who reached out; Yes, I am alive and well.

"resilient:
adjective

able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions

If I didn’t see it I wouldn’t believe it. I wish I had taken a picture of it on the giant pile of rubble that was the last 21 years of my life (combined with most of my neighbors kitchen)

This mug. This twenty three year old @crateandbarrel mug. This lone survivor of everything lost as my kitchen burned and then collapsed into the carport below (see second picture)

This mug was just sitting there, waiting patiently to be picked up. She’s a bit dirty, but she’s intact. This mug was part of a complete set of dishes givin to me as a wedding present. The marriage ended but the mug remained. Hardly used as all coffee addicts like me tend to have a favorite and it’s usually bigger. This twenty three year old orphaned mug will be my mug of choice once I get settled. 

This little mug is what will give me hope as I heal from this horrible tragedy as it’s a tangible reminder that we can go through hell and still end up ok. Maybe a bit battered and bruised, but ok. Thank you little mug for giving me the will to go on when each day brings more challenges. When each morning is a painful reminder of what was lost. While I will never be able to replace so many lost and cherished items I will always be grateful that I’m still here. My daughter is still here. My neighbors are still here. My friends are still here. And my little mug is still here.  #palisades #palisadesfire #resilient #palistrong #crateandbarrel",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFMLdcypeK_/,2025-01-24 01:42:42+00:00

"KRISTIN CROWLEY has been Chief of the LA Fire Department since 2022, a position she earned rung by rung. She entered the LAFD in 1998, when she ""placed among the top 50 scores out of 16,000 applicants,"" the dept. told City News Service. She rose ""through the ranks as firefighter, firefighter paramedic, engineer, fire inspector, captain I, captain II, battalion chief, assistant chief,"" CNS continues, becoming LAFD's 1st woman fire marshal and 2nd woman deputy chief. She is now LAFD's 1st woman and 1st openly queer (lesbian) chief. 

Crowley's appointment to chief came amidst alarm about hazing and other harassment of women firefighters in the LAFD and across the nation, with women quitting rather than reporting abuse, for fear of retaliation. ""A highly anticipated survey of the LAFD's workplace culture released in November [2021] found that more than half of female firefighters reported bullying and harassment as sources of conflict,” The LA Times summarized. ""Just 13% of female firefighters believe the LAFD is interested in their well-being, the survey found."" As of Jan. 2022, the dept only had 117 women firefighters, making up just 3.5% of the LAFD. 

Like any minority in a given field, those few women have persevered by being extra good at what they do #burdenofrepresentation, such that their 3.5% holds 10% of leadership positions, according to then-Mayor Garcetti upon his appointment of Crowley. Unfortunately, such success makes it very easy for detractors to chock up their leadership to tokenism, as we have heard directed at Crowley during these fires. 

The media-hyped anonymous letter from alleged “retired and active LAFD chief officers"" particularly took issue with Crowley speaking out against LAFD budget cuts made by City Hall--that she spoke out while fighting these major fires, as if she was politicking rather than focusing on her work. Crowley's ""outburst"" has actually brought her further respect within the LAFD, as previous chiefs have been shy of criticizing their own boss, the mayor. It showed that she is not, in fact, interested in politics. It also brought public attention to the LAFD budget, especially in contrast to the LAPD’s. #priorities",359524998,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFMQt-Qv0-b/,2025-01-24 02:28:38+00:00

"⚡️SAVED - PAUL REVERE WILLIAMS ⚡️In the wake of the recent Palisades Fire, we are grateful to report that the W.H. and Alvarita Theobald House, designed by the legendary Paul Revere Williams in 1930, remains standing. Located in Pacific Palisades, this home is a masterful example of California Colonial Revival architecture, showcasing Williams’ ability to blend timeless elegance with functional design. The house gained recognition early on, being featured in Architectural Digest in 1930 and California Arts and Architecture in February 1934. Its distinctive lighting fixtures, designed by Edward Carr, further highlight the home’s artistic and architectural significance.

As the first Black architect inducted into the American Institute of Architects (AIA), Williams broke barriers and shaped Southern California’s architectural identity with his visionary designs. The Theobald House is not just a residence—it is a historical landmark that speaks to his extraordinary contributions to architecture and the enduring importance of preserving his work for future generations.

"THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THE PEOPLE OF L.A. AND ALTADENA @WALKGOODLA …WE WILL AMPLIFY THE WORK. 
-
Posted @withregram • @walkgoodla LA, it’s time to take charge of your health now. 

We are in unprecedented territory as the burn zone has well surpassed the size of San Francisco. It’s important that we are all aware as a community that urban fires bring different challenges. It’s also important that we stay collected. We look to 9/11 and the Lahaina fires as examples of how smoke and ash exposure can lead to long term health consequences within the affected population. Think of all of the material in a home, on a car, in a business or old building. Those chemicals and components are now in the ash that we see collecting on surfaces in LA. 

And while we have a human urge to return to normalcy so quickly, we should first ask ourselves if it is safe to do so. 

Slide 5 contains current best practices that we know of so far. There is a public webinar occurring tomorrow 1.24 at 3pm PT from the Coalition of Clean Air. They will have new insights on air quality, water safety and hazardous waste, with a panel of experts to answer your questions. The panel includes representatives from South Coast Air Quality Mgmt District, Dept of Toxic Substances Control and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Link in the bio to register for the webinar. We will also be taking notes and making them available for the community ❤️

If you must go outside, use your best judgment and take the necessary preventative health measures currently available

"Loss has a way of shaping us in ways we never imagined. Six years ago, the love of my life and I took a house that held so much history and turned it into a home—one filled with magic, love, and memories that my grandparents Jan & Frank would have been so proud of. Together, we transformed it into something truly special, a place where the past and present met in harmony.

But life has a way of challenging us in unimaginable ways. My love passed away shortly thereafter, and now, in the fires, I’ve lost the house we rebuilt together—the home that was our dream.

Through it all, I’ve learned the art of letting go while carrying pieces of what was into what will be. We scattered his ashes in the ocean right in front of The Day House on Carbon Beach in Malibu, from a boat that felt like it carried the weight of my heart. And now, I will scatter the ashes of the home we recreated together, releasing the past to make way for the future.

Loss teaches us resilience. It teaches us how to move forward, even when it feels impossible. The key is to keep looking ahead—to dream new dreams, to create new magical experiences, to hold onto the hope of what the future can hold.

To the thousands of people who are going through this terrible loss, my heart goes out to you. Together, we will make it through this and build our lives back again. With the help of one another, we will rise like a phoenix from the ashes, stronger and more determined than ever ❤️

"This week’s Daily Lift, “Safe in Wind and Fire” by Cindy Martin, reminds us of the power of prayer in times of uncertainty. Cindy shares her personal experience during a fierce wildfire and powerful winds in California. As flames roared and winds swept through, Cindy turned to God, knowing that divine harmony is always present, even in the most destructive forces of nature.

In the face of these fierce elements, Cindy and her husband prayed, affirming that God’s calming presence could quiet the storm. And as they relied on divine guidance, the winds subsided, and the fire was contained, sparing homes and lives.

We continue to hold those affected by California’s wildfires in our prayers, trusting that God’s peace and protection are always at hand. As Cindy reminded us, Mary Baker Eddy wrote, “Moral and spiritual might belong to the Spirit which holds the wind in His fist.”

In every storm—whether literal or metaphorical—we can find comfort in knowing that God’s voice is always with us, guiding and protecting.

"Our Los Angeles landscape has forever changed. In the face of monumental destruction our city is hard at work; organizing to support those in need. We commend the heroic first responders who continue to fight the fires and protect the communities we love. For those that have lost everything the long road to rebuild has only begun.

Just today we were able to return to our Malibu HQ to continue to move our operations forward. Our small team has been diligently and passionately keeping our doors open as we prepare for the @cabanashow in Miami next week. We are proud of the evolution of our brand and despite this recent challenge we are excited to present our SS25 and R26 collections to the world. We recognize how hard it is to continue to work in times like these, and we are grateful for our Dos Gardenias family as we keep each other afloat with levity, kindness, and dedication. 

As a team we have made the decision to offer the gift of Dos Gardenias to our friends and loyal customers who have lost their belongings in the Los Angeles fires. Simply send us an email at info@dosgardenias.com and share your situation to start the process. In addition, we will donate all profits from the sales of our Resort 2025 collection from now until May 1st to @formosafirerelief, a grassroots local community-based fire relief organization, facilitating ongoing efforts to assist LA Fire victims and evacuees.

"Pandemics, fires, division, unrest… can we catch a break?

Well, the world is going to keep throwing curveballs at us whether we like it or not. It’s our own responsibility to ground and recharge so we don’t fizzle away. 

Take a look around. It’s not 2019 anymore, and there’s no going back to the world we once knew. (Keep an open mind now…)

The structures, systems, and beliefs that once felt solid are shifting beneath our feet, asking us to evolve alongside them. 

The energy of transformation is everywhere—from the way we work and connect to the way we view health, technology, and even the planet itself. (Hello AI, medical “advancements,” and crypto). 

Will you resist and struggle, or will you embrace the flow and allow growth to unfold? 

The choice is yours. But remember, nature still wins. You aren’t an AI robot. You are nature. Don’t venture too far away from it.

"Did you know your pet’s natural detoxification system is their first line of defense against environmental toxins? 

From wildfire pollutants to everyday exposure, our pets face invisible challenges that don’t just affect their lungs—they can enter the bloodstream, fuel inflammation, and strain their overall health.

Here’s the good news: their bodies are designed to detox, and with the right support, you can help optimize those processes! 

Supplements like curcumin, sulforaphane (from broccoli, check out our past reel on broccoli and how to prepare it for your pet), chlorella, and milk thistle strengthen liver function, while NAC promotes glutathione production (the body’s master antioxidant) and supports lung health by breaking down mucus.

✨ Start small: choose one or two supplements and consult your vet to customize a plan. Every little step helps your pet stay resilient, no matter the environment. 

Comment below if you’d like to learn more about detox supplements for pets!

"Swipe  to read. Share if this resonates.  

Losing our family home in the Pacific Palisades fire has tested me in ways I never imagined. I fought until I had nothing left - physically, emotionally. And yet, in the end, I had to surrender.

Not to give up, but to trust. 

To trust that God has a bigger plan, even if I can’t see it yet.

This experience has challenged me to lean on my faith, to find purpose in the pain, and to use this story as a catalyst for something greater.

I’m still in the midst of healing, but one thing is clear:

We always have a choice in the story we tell ourselves.

This is mine.

Read the full carousel for the lessons I’ve learned - and how I’m choosing to move forward.

Drop a   if this resonates with you. 

Thank you for your kindness, support, and for being a part of the bigger story creating much needed change.

Don’t be ignorant to what can’t be seen by the human eye, or to AQ meters that can’t detect what they’re not programmed to detect.

Exciting things.

"PAULO’S FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE: For those who find it difficult to accept help, seek any way possible to provide something in return. It makes accepting that help easier.
.
I know there are so many out there just like me, who find it unbelievably difficult to accept all the help that so many gracious and wonderful people have offered. Incredible humans from all aspects of life have shown up with texts, calls, visits, hugs, donations, dinners, and pretty much assistance in every way. After losing everything, this outpouring of kindness is honestly the only thing keeping us afloat through all the mire. I can hardly talk about it without getting emotional. Eventually, I want to thank each and every person individually. But bear with me. If I haven’t thanked you personally, please know how appreciative I am.
.
But that still doesn’t change my inner wiring which makes accepting this help so difficult. I’ve always found it so much easier to help someone else rather than accept that help myself. I can’t explain it. I guess I’ve had to fight for so much for so long that I take pride in that fight. But Paulo helped me realize that I CAN still help. Even though I currently have no financial means, any “things” left in my life that I could donate, or even much time right now as it’s overwhelming how much there is to do... there is always something I can give.
.
For me, it was blood. We all have that. And so many people need it right now. So head to the Red Cross if you can. If there are any other people like me that find it difficult to receive, this is a good solution. It really did help my psyche, and cushion the blow to accept the help that (as much as I hate to say it) I, and so many others, desperately need. Thank you Paulo. You are so wise.

"“It doesn’t interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the fire with me and not shrink back.” ✨ The Invitation, Oriah Mountain Dreamer

LA, my home of 11 years — forever changed, yet unbroken ❤️‍

These past few weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions: devastation, resilience, fear, and unmeasurable hope. Witnessing the wildfires’ destruction has been heartbreaking, but seeing our community’s incredible solidarity has been beautiful.

I’m safe — but ‘safe’ feels complicated. For over a week, I’d fall asleep exhausted and wake up with tears streaming down my face. I know I’m not the only one carrying this weight. Processing, and learning that it’s okay to feel everything at once. Sad. Inspired. Scared. Determined. Our city is hurting, but we’re holding each other up to heal together

LA is my dream. And no wildfire can extinguish that. ❤️‍

"Standing Together Against Wildfires in LA

依然として猛威を振るう山火事により、ロサンゼルスは深い悲しみに包まれています。しかし、普段は自己中心的と言われがちなLAの人々も今は心を一つにし、互いに助け合うことで絆を深めています。

自分達にできることは募金をしたり必要な物資を届けたりすることです。そして、自然の脅威に立ち向かう消防士の皆様には心から感謝の意を表します。セガレもこの状況を感じ取り、アートを通じて祈りを捧げています

As a Los Angeles native and Palisades High School alumna, the fires have impacted both my family and my broader community. While my neighborhood is safe, my heart breaks for so many who have lost so much. I am also full of gratitude for the tremendous community support and hard work of the first responders. 

I appreciate being interviewed for this excellent article on the impact of wildfire on our skin and hair by @softblond for @ps.beauty. I hope these tips are helpful as we all navigate these challenging times. I hope everyone stays safe and well!

"Headed to a new framer today to get quotes. I’m about to frame a lot of my Polaroids for the upcoming group exhibition with @altavistaarts at the Milan Photo Fair happening in March.
.
This Polaroid was taken of my friend @jennah.ferrer.foronda during a workshop at Alexandra Franzens family home about 10ish years ago.
.
I decided stitch on it after Jenna passed away a few years later. It happened suddenly..just a few months after we put together our first art exhibition in Paris. It was shocking. I talked with her frequently during the weeks leading up to her death.
.
I decided to include this one in the Milan exhibition only to find out yesterday that the Franzen family home burned to the ground in the Palisades fire.
.
The cycle of life/death/rebirth is potent inside this one Polaroid. You never know when you make your work what it’s going to hold or how important that photograph is going to be or how the meaning of it will change over time and mean more to you than you thought it would. 
.
I didn’t realize the significance the stitched spiral would be. 
.
This brings to light the fact that following your intuition and making the work…even if you don’t know why… is so important. @cigharvey says that your work is light years ahead of you. You think you know what it’s about, but years later it has something to tell you that you didn’t expect. That’s definitely been true for me and this Polaroid is no exception. 
.
I know how difficult it can be to follow the urge to create.. so many negative beliefs or the never ending to-do list that we put in our way so that we don’t have to face the vulnerability that comes when we make art. But this Polaroid is a testament of how important it is to get out of your own way and just make the work. 
.
Art is Medicine. If you’d like support getting through the self doubt and false narratives and get back to making your art click the link for my Make the Work course. There’s still time to join us.

"I was 16 years old when my home burned down in a wildfire. It was one of the most devastating events of my life. 

The fires in California have only intensified since then. I’ve spoken with quite a few people this month for have been impacted by the wildfires in LA. My heart goes out to you. If you have lost your home or not, there are so many symptoms related to wildfires and natural disasters that make it difficult to continue with “life as normal”. It will never be the same ever again and that grief is REAL. 

Right now we are a community in shock. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, as a survivor and therapist who has come out the other side I would recommend you get in community (even if you don’t always feel like it). Grief is not meant to be experienced alone. 

Need more support? Seek out a mental health therapist with experience in trauma. 

If you are a mental health therapist who is available feel free to comment a little about yourself below. Let’s connect and remind each other the struggle is real but we aren’t alone.

Over three intense days, we witnessed the aftermath of the Palisades Fire—scorched landscapes and communities working to rebuild—and got an up-close look at the relentless battle against a fire in Brentwood.
From the incredible bravery of firefighters to the resilience of those impacted, these moments were unforgettable. We put together a 20-minute special featuring our coverage, highlighting the destruction, the efforts to contain the fires, and the stories of those affected.

"President Donald Trump, who has criticized state and local leaders over water policies and forest-management practices, landed in Los Angeles County on Friday afternoon, Jan. 24, en route to survey the massive damage from recent wildfires.

Trump, newly sworn in this week as the nation’s 47th president, got a first-hand look at the staggering toll of the Palisades fire, which broke out on Jan. 7 amid extreme winds in the region. The visit did not include a trip, at least by ground, to see the devastation of the Eaton fire in Altadena and Pasadena or meet with residents there.

"Thanks to World Central Kitchen @wckitchen, who generously sponsored all the delicious hot meals during the @smcedu Foundation’s Disaster Support Distribution event. 
As I was waiting for my burrito I met Mel, a fellow Pinay, and we talked about how our day was going. 
That’s when I paused for a moment, looked at Mel’s shirt with the WCK logo on it and realized that I’ve seen @chefjoseandres’ WCK team feeding and supporting communities during disasters all over the world—and now, here they were, in our own backyard in Los Angeles area. 
I teared up, thanked Mel deeply for being here, and shared why I was so emotional. 
She got it. 
@chefjoseandres I hope you know what an incredible blessing you are to people all over the world. You not only nourish our bodies with food but also fill our souls with your love and compassion. Gracias por todo!

"#SpencerPratt and #HeidiMontag are suing the city of #LosAngeles and the #DepartmentOfWater over damages from the #PalisadesFire! 

Per #LATimes, the couple filed on Tuesday, claiming ‘inverse condemnation’—a legal term that demands compensation for property damage caused by public use. They’re also calling out the #SantaYnezReservoir for being empty and offline before the fires even started.

LA Times reported the reservoir’s been under repair for over a year. Back in January 2024, the DWP’s chief of water operations pushed for it to be finished ASAP, but it won’t be finished until May 2025. DWP officials said even if the reservoir was full, it’s unclear how much it would’ve helped firefighters. As of Thursday, 72% of the fire is contained.

The complaint further calls for improvements to water infrastructure to reduce risks in the future.

What are your thoughts on this lawsuit? Let us know below!  Looks like the #CelebLawsuits aren’t stopping in 2025...

"When do the Boyz you grew up become Men? “At times when everything falls apart you often find some profoundly beautiful acts of care and resilience by the people affected.” Wrote photographer Emma Marie Jenkinson for @voguemagazine . 
•
In times of war some of the boys you knew in grade school and high school will join the military to stand and fight for the soil they want to protect- their home, their families, their neighborhood. We in Malibu, the Palisades, and all around Southern California have just been through war. Unfortunately our adversary is more unpredictable than another human army or country… it is Mother Earth. We have learned a lot from battling fire after fire. We have bound together as a community and not only have our firefighters and first responders stepped up in armor in our times of need, a “cowboy collective” of volunteer firefighters, our friends, neighbors, the boys we all grew up with that are now parents, uncles, and young men now have stepped up to protect those around them- the soil they love, and their community. We are so grateful to them!  Many of the homes still standing today here in Malibu after the recent #palisadesfire or #franklinfire , are here because of the Community Fire Brigades @communitybrigade developed  after the #woolseyfire in partnership with LA Emergency Preparedness Foundation and the LA County Fire Dept. 
•
Thank you @keegan_gibbs @kellyjacobsonnn @jeff__spiegel @maliburealestate and many others around us for helping protect our neighborhoods and community we love so much here in Malibu. We are so grateful to you. Also to my brother in law Fletcher @fletchboyardee for all your hard work being a paramedic firefighter, so grateful for all you do for us and who you are ❤️.

"JANUARY 25

PACIFIC PALISADES—Robert, Nicholas, and Wyatt Bridges installed this yesterday to inspire those making their re: entry back into their town…so that they may not to lose hope amongst the rubble. 

Sunset Boulevard, in between Brooktree & Chautauqua. This image is not: iykyk. Everyone knows this image — past, present, and now today.

This house was like a beacon, a lighthouse…every time I reached it on Sunset I knew I was about to be home.

Let’s remember The Robert Bridges House as its past and its today. (Taken at 1:08PM PST, 01/24/25, right after the National guard and LAPD blocked off the Palisades for Trump’s visit. I don’t believe anyone besides those exiting + military were able to pass this for the rest of the day. 

Mr. Robert Bridges expressed it as a fact that they would rebuild. 

Together with his sons, who grew up in this house, they chose hope. 

I’d like to think of this as a metaphor for our country as it should be, but perhaps not as how it is right now. Specifically not what it became on January 21st, nor how it’s small but mighty coastal and mountainous towns were leveled January 7, 8, and 9.

Thank you to the Bridges family for this act of kindness, resilience, and hope.

"Feeling more grateful than ever to call LA home after the past few weeks we’ve had 

For a moment, it felt like we might lose the magic of this city that inspires people to come here and create their own. My heart goes out to everyone affected by the fires. Seeing the loss is heartbreaking and I’m hoping for the healing and recovery for everyone impacted. Losing what you love is one of the hardest experiences to face and a reminder to live fully. Carrying that reminder with me into this year to approach each day with a little more gratitude and make the most of each moment. Super excited to share the magic I’ve been working on and resume collaborating with my amazing friends to create even more.

"Here’s a glimpse of the infamous home located off of Sunset Boulevard that survived the #PalisadesFire—and it didn’t happen by chance. This home had no shingles on the roof for embers to settle, minimal vegetation in the front yard, and an empty lot next door that the wind happened to be blowing from.

This home stands as a reminder that when it comes to wildfires, preparation is everything. Some things can’t be predicted, but others can. Take the time to create defensible space around your property and keep your home safe.

I created these slides with @resiliencealliance. They’re full of helpful tips on how to deal with all the toxic ash, especially if you’re in/near a burn zone. We have so much ash on our porch, cars, roof, just everywhere. I’m glad I saw this information before we attempted to clean it up.

"On top of being able to photograph the Oregon strike teams, I learned that an old friend of mine from my EMT days was leading one of the groups.

Chief Tom Jackson began working working for the same ambulance company in the late 1980s, then went to paramedic school in the early 90s.  We both worked out of our Santa Monica station in the mid 90s, where we contracted with the Santa Monica Fire Department.

Tom's goal, though, was to become a firefighter.  After moving out of California, Tom fulfilled his dream. I eventually met up with him years later, in 2017, when I drove up to Oregon to photograph the solar eclipse and found him working as a Battalion Chief for the Newport Fire Department. 

Shortly afterward, Tom was appointed as Fire Chief for neighboring Depoe Bay Fire Department.  As tired as he was after over a week of fighting the Palisades Fire, Tom let me photograph him on the pier before he and his team returned to Oregon. 

It's always great to see good friends succeed.  Better still to see that they're just as committed to their chosen career as they were when they were young. 

I'm proud to call you my friend, Tommy.

"UPDATE on the #lawildfires response:

Our #LACountySearchDogs, K9 Clifford and K9 Prentiss, have been tirelessly searching through the devastation caused by the Palisades and Eaton Fires. Their determination and skill are instrumental as we continue working to locate those still missing amidst the wreckage.

The toll as of Jan. 25, 2025:

Eaton Fire: 17 confirmed fatalities, 18 still missing

Palisades Fire: 10 confirmed fatalities, 8 still missing

Our mission is clear: to bring closure to families and help our community begin to rebuild. Each bark, alert, and search is a step closer to that goal.

Thank you to everyone who has shown support for our teams. Your words of encouragement fuel them during these long days. Please continue to keep the impacted families, our first responders, and these resilient dogs in your thoughts.

"We Will Dine Again

It was unbelievable to come back and see our house burned. To see the devastation left behind, with boxes from our garage thrown all the way into the pool by the unprecedented winds. And yet, despite the chaos and destruction, one thing stood out: the outdoor table. It was still exactly where it had always been, just a skeleton with the bones still in tact—almost as if our souls were still sitting there, dining in defiance of the storm and fire raging around.

This terrace was once the heart of our home—a place where laughter echoed, where friends and family came together for ocean-view dinners, and where unforgettable moments were made under the stars. It was a place of connection, joy, and love.

Now, all that remains is ash and rubble, a stark reminder of how fragile life can be. Seeing the destruction after the fires, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed, like rebuilding is an impossible dream. But when I look back at the memories we created here—the meals shared, the conversations that stretched into the night—I know those moments are worth fighting for.

We must hold those memories close to gain the strength to rebuild. To put one foot in front of the other, even when it feels like the weight of loss is too heavy. We can honor what once was by daring to imagine what can be.

This table may be gone, but the love, the laughter, the spirit of those moments—those will never be lost. They are the motivation to create something new, to rebuild, to come together once again.

To everyone who has lost so much in these fires, my heart is with you. Together, we will find the strength to rebuild our lives, one step at a time. We will dine again.

A Division Chief (the Washington County Strike Team Leader) as well as an engine staffed by a Captain and three firefighters served 2 weeks in the Los Angeles area, mostly around Pacific Palisades and Malibu. Their Strike Team was made up of firefighters from Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue, Hillsboro Fire & Rescue and Banks Fire District. In total they were gone 18 days, with 4 of those days used to travel to and from the incident. 

We are extremely proud of our firefighters and the opportunity to help our neighbors in California. The crew will get some rest and spend some time with their families.

"“LA, it’s time to take charge of your health now.

We are in unprecedented territory as the burn zone has well surpassed the size of San Francisco. It’s important that we are all aware as a community that urban fires bring different challenges. It’s also important that we stay collected. We look to 9/11 and the Lahaina fires as examples of how smoke and ash exposure can lead to long term health consequences within the affected population. Think of all of the material in a home, on a car, in a business or old building. Those chemicals and components are now in the ash that we see collecting on surfaces in LA.

And while we have a human urge to return to normalcy so quickly, we should first ask ourselves if it is safe to do so.

Slide 5 contains current best practices that we know of so far. There are public webinars from @cleanairca. They have new insights on air quality, water safety and hazardous waste, with a panel of experts to answer your questions.

If you must go outside, use your best judgment and take the necessary preventative health measures currently available

This morning I returned to Big Rock where I once lived many years ago. The devastation is beyond comprehension. The house that David and I bought six months ago nearby is miraculously still there, but the majority of my neighborhood is burned to the ground.

My friend @elle.sue.bea saw what’s left of her home today after the #palisadesfire. She ran her nonprofit, @deityanimalrescue from there and saved the lives of so many sweet dogs, many of them special needs. 

The destruction of both this fire and the #EatonFire is hard to fully grasp until you see it in person. Thousands have lost their homes and businesses and every single person has a unique and important story to share.

"Sacramento Firefighters Return From Helping in LA

Per Sac Metro:

“Metro Fire is proud to announce that our regional OES Type 1 and Type 3 strike teams have returned home safely after 16 days on the front lines battling the devastating fires in Los Angeles County. These teams worked alongside agencies from across the state and beyond, protecting countless lives and properties in the face of the most challenging and dangerous conditions.

Our returning firefighters have shared stories of the incredible community support they encountered during their deployment. Meals prepared or donated by neighbors, signs of gratitude along roadways, and heartfelt words of encouragement from those they served. This outpouring of kindness reminded all of our fire family that they were not just fighting fires, but also protecting the hopes and futures of families across California.

To the families of our deployed personnel, thank you. Your support and sacrifice during these challenging weeks have made it possible for your loved ones to answer the call to serve. We are deeply grateful for your partnership in this mission. Metro Fire remains committed to serving our region and beyond, bringing hope and relief wherever it’s needed most. Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Compare the upper and lower bricks. The interior became an oven that cooked the bricks lighter (the whitest ones were always white, glazed).
Up top, the flames rose so quickly it took them half a meter to leave their carbon trace on the chimney.

Their job is to look out for your best interests whereas the “independent adjuster” sent by your insurance company works for them and gets paid to minimize their costs.

I want to help more people, but what can two kids do?” My daughter, Charlotte (8) suggested, “a fundraiser, is that a stupid idea?” We discussed how we could make a small difference, and came up with an idea.

"I knew January was going to be momentous⚡️
But never ever did losing my Community cross my Consciousness. 
That would be, and I am learning now, unfathomable. 
Most of us in the Collective felt this. And knew big changes were coming. All the signs pointing to 2025 welcoming massive shifts. 

I spent all of the Christmas Holiday having a major Detox. Which is what I call “sickness”. I had multiple days of a high fever, could not eat for a week, could barely sip liquids. I wasn’t scared. I knew it was a purge. A die off. My family was off skiing having a great time which was wonderful. I could sleep and be alone in my home and heal. Everyday I kept saying to myself, I am so grateful to have this still and quiet time alone in my Home. I was taking it all in. I was very nostalgic. This was such a blessing. 

When my family returned, we did a beautiful deep clean. All of the closets looked and felt amazing. I had 4 bags of clothes to donate (they were in my car when we evacuated). That Sunday night we all discussed how amazing our Home felt. The best it ever had. 
Who knew that only two days later, it would all be released. 

Our Home was a Sanctuary for us. She loved and protected us well. 
Our neighbors looked out for us as we did for them. 
This Community gave us so much that will always live on in our Hearts. No matter what happens, if people rebuild and come back, or move on, Pacific Palisades will always be the most precious place and Community. A Village within a big city. A gem nestled in the Hills. 

I know that thousands of us are taking it hour by hour right now. As is right. Please allow whatever you feel to BE felt and seen. Let it all come and wash over you. And leave again. You do not have to have any answers now. You do not have to have your plan. You do not owe anyone a call back or explanation. Protect your peace. Dwell in the Silence to hear your answers when you can.
I love you.

Anna Babayan, the school’s chairlady, shared, “We are absolutely thrilled about the bears! I can already picture the joy on our babies’ faces—they are going to be over the moon. This has been such a difficult time for our SMACS family, and yet, the kindness and support from incredible people like you have truly made all the difference in our healing journey. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for bringing light into our lives during this challenging period.”

"WE NEED YOU @ ORANGE CITY COUNCIL MEETING, TUESDAY, 1/28/2025, 6PM, 300 E Chapman Ave, Orange, 92866.

Please attend and speak about how you have been affected by any of the wildfires that have ravaged OC and the rest of SoCal over the past decade at the Orange City Council meeting this Tuesday. Wear your No Orange Heights shirt, if you have one.

We know we’ve been hearing the same repetitive reply from our city leaders, that everything is out of their hands and there’s nothing they can do any longer … but that’s not true! The sad news of the recent wildfires jumping outside of wildlife corridors into neighborhoods, has strengthened our argument that developing anything at all in the Orange Heights open space is a terrible idea. 

The short sighted idea of building homes for a short term tax revenue gain will be met with untimely irony when multi millions (if not billions) are spent to mitigate a wildfire disaster. 

The whole area burned down in 2017 and with Southern Californians weather conditions getting progressively windier and drier every year, it’s only a matter of time before it happens again … and as heartbreaking as it is to see animal homes destroyed - if the development continues - it would be peoples homes, lives, stories, futures, destroyed along with the homes of the animals.

" I lost everything, but not my hope.

Now the fire is in my heart. I know this cannot wait—the time is now, and it must get done. Not just to help others, but to help me too.

When wildfires swept through Malibu, they took my home, my stability, and the life I had built from the ground up. They took the beach that healed my heart—the one where I ran every day with the dog, Simba. They took my my barefoot walks and eating from the garden, my job, and separated me from my community and Simba.

But they couldn’t take my inner peace or my faith that I’m here to create something meaningful—not just for me, but for all of us.

I’m rebuilding my life from scratch, but I’m also working on BlueprintX, a platform that empowers people to rebuild their lives and bring their ideas to life successfully. It’s the ship we need to rise from loss and create a better future—for fire survivors, dreamers, and changemakers alike.

But I can’t do it alone.

"With the fires in LA, Valley Angel is releasing an 11:11 hoodie and donating a portion of the proceeds to the LA Fire Foundation, The Red Cross, California Fire Foundation, Eaton Canyon Fire & Relief Recovery Fund, and the Fire Aid Benefit Concert. 
It’s saddening to see the place I grew up in experiencing these fires all at once, and seeing so many people lose their homes. As all of you may know, Valley Angel is a brand based on angelic signs and LA. With that being said, this specific design is paying homage to the city where most of my inspiration and upbringing came from. 11:11 is believed to be an angel number when manifestations and intentions hold the most significance in the law of attraction with the synchronicity of the time 11:11. Something that I will be manifesting is for our angels to protect LA, our City of Angels ❤️‍ 
Please share, repost, and/or donate through purchasing a hoodie at the shop link in bio. Proceeds from the purchases will be donated and equally distributed among the organizations mentioned above. Thank you

"Dear Janet Heller Fine Jewelry Community.

Over the past few weeks, we have stepped back from social media to fully dedicate ourselves to helping those affected by the devastating fires. As a proud board member of Connecting a Caring Community, I am in awe of the incredible work we are doing to support the victims. We have raised thousands of dollars, gathered pallets of clothing, fed hundreds of first responders and the National Guard, set up distribution centers in Altadena offering gift cards, haircuts, blankets, clothing and much much more!! And we are just getting started. 

While the immediate crisis has passed, we know the road to recovery is long, and the challenges many face will extend far beyond these catastrophic events. Please know that we are committed to being here for the long haul, providing support and resources to help rebuild lives and restore hope.

To those of you who have reached out about replacing your jewelry you lost in the LA fires, we are ready whenever you are. We are here to assist you in any way we can as you begin to move forward.

Jewelry tells stories of love, triumph, and cherished moments—but it is the resilience, compassion, and unity of a community that truly shine in times of darkness. Together, we can continue to make a difference.

With love and unwavering support,
Janet

2 weeks ago - we made a post wanting to provide free therapy to help, and today we’ve connected families in need to hand-picked therapists from our network of 1,000+ licensed providers.

thanks to you, those families have seen our posts & yesterday was the first time we’ve been at an event in LA since the fires started. @riselafest brought so many people together to support LA fire relief. shoutout @musicares

"Don't let the storm clouds fool you. Do we need rain? Yes. But are the Palisades houses that didn't burn now in jeopardy of mudslide? Yes. The fires have burned many feet deep of roots and the charred soil doesn't absorb the water. These homes are just a few that survived the fire but aren't out of the woods.

"A heartfelt thank you to the compassionate friends, talented fashion designers, and amazing strangers who have so generously helped us fire victims rebuild our wardrobes with such style, speed, and thoughtfulness. ❤️ Your kindness has truly made this journey brighter.

Special thanks to @rossmorestudio for these fabulous sunnies, @dlashes for the chic leopard stole, @sloanbella for my gorgeous new boots, and @debbie.bean for my absolute favorite new trousers. ❤️

As a fashion designer, one of the hardest things to accept after losing our home in the fires was realizing how much of my life’s passion disappeared with it. It wasn’t just about having clothes to wear—it was about the beautiful pieces I had been collecting for over 25 years, gone in an instant.

Fashion has always been more than just clothes to me—it’s self-expression, it’s art, it’s escape. It’s my story, stitched together through decades of memories.

In the midst of this loss, something extraordinary happened. Friends, strangers, acquaintances—people I never expected—reached out in the most incredible ways. Invitations to fashion gifting suites. Suitcases filled with designer clothes, shoes, bags, and jewelry showed up at the door. Gift certificates to my favorite stores. Vintage treasures sent with love.

It felt like a whirlwind of kindness and generosity flooded into my life. And through this outpouring of support, I was reminded of the joy fashion brings—the thrill of putting on something beautiful, the comfort of feeling like yourself again. These gifts weren’t just about the clothes; they gave me a sense of normalcy, excitement, and a renewed spirit.

To every person, designer, and company who is helping outfit those of us who escaped these fires, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your generosity has given us more than just clothes on our backs—you’ve given us hope and the courage to dream again… and most important, a sense of normalcy again ❤️

Each one was the most important to someone out there tonight.

"In the Palisades fire zone on Sunday. The landscape is truly hard to comprehend. Sunset Blvd, really?! The task to remove all of the fire damaged remnants of people’s homes and lives seems daunting. Yet teams allowed in for whatever their job is (like restoration crews for homes still standing) were there at work. In the rain. Fire station 69 was saved as mentioned by President Trump in his visit on Friday. National Guard is at the checkpoints. One telling me they’re sleeping 3 to 5 hours a night and living off of coffee. A resident drove by to drop off coffee. 

Stopped by some spots of memory for me. So thrilled to see my friend’s condo still standing. As a new area was opened to residents she was allowed to see her property on Sunday.

"1/17 - I was out running an errand, and as I was pulling up to a traffic light, I had seen this group of Firefighters hopping out of their truck, holding their laundry bags on the way to do some laundry.. As I always say to do, I pulled down my window and Thanked them for their service..
The immediately waved with smiles and thanked me and I could genuinely feel the great sense of appreciation they had for me saying that. 
I ended up pulling over to chat with them, and found out they had all come down from Oregon to help with the fires. They dropped everything back home, their day to day, their families, all to come down here and help with this chaos. They had been here a week, and were here for at least another week.
As usual, nothing but kind and gentle souls and good humans. These are the faces of true heroes.. 
I felt truly grateful to be able to look each one of them in the eyes and shake their hands thanking them. 
And by the end, their deep gratitude and appreciation had made me a bit emotional as I really wasn’t the one who had done anything, and they were the ones that were doing Everything.

"We do not own a Tesla, but when we bought our house in May, there was a Tesla charger inside a corner of the garage. We were never advised by an inspector to remove it or told it could be a fire hazard. It was simply an appliance that we didn’t use nor did we think about. 

So imagine our shock when we thought our home, which has smoke and ash contamination from the #palisadesfire , had escaped actual fire damage BUT IT DID NOT. 

When we opened our garage door on Friday, we discovered that the Tesla charger had exploded and caught fire. Thank God we had a sprinkler system that saved our entire house from burning down. 

In other words, our home could have been destroyed, not by the palisades fire directly, but from a Tesla charger!!! 

Interestingly, there was no heat damage at all around the outside of that garage… No rubber, plastic or glass had been damaged.

Wondering if anyone has ever heard of a Tesla charger, not charging anything or attached to a battery or car, exploding and catching fire?

SO MANY QUESTIONS.",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFVxrChySd_/,2025-01-27 19:09:46+00:00

"Another shipment of dry shampoo headed to families who have lost everything in the fires in CA. 

Thank you so much to @risinglightsproject for helping me last week to fill the dry shampoo containers- it was an amazing day. Our community is helping other communities across the country in need. That’s what it’s all about. I feel honored to be part of it. 

It seems so small to hand someone a dry shampoo when they just lost everything they own- but every little thing helps. Many don’t know when their next shower will be and to have these kits of essentials helps to feel somewhat “normal” in a time where it feels anything but normal. 

Thank you to @drashleybeckman who is helping 25+ families in her community. 

Thank you to @keriparkerinc and @shawnesssss who have helped so many in their community in CA as well.

"Obviously it’s nothing compared to the losses some are grieving, but I was looking at this one photo I took in November and recognizing it’s all burned. It was taken looking south from a rocky outcrop above Santa Ynez falls, one of my favorite spots to stop and sit. I know the scrub and chaparral should recover, but it will take a while before this view looks anything like this again.

The maps with the red/orange/yellow lines are my Strava heat maps of the area (yellow is where I run often, orange less often, and red probably once or twice). The fire perimeter maps are from CAL FIRE.

"If you believe a third party’s negligence caused harm during the Eaton fires, here’s how we evaluate cases:

1️⃣ Did they have a duty to act safely?
2️⃣ Did they fail to meet safety standards?
3️⃣ Did their actions cause the fire or your losses?
4️⃣ Have you suffered property, financial, or emotional harm?
5️⃣ Could a utility company, contractor, or manufacturer be liable?

We’re here to seek justice and hold the responsible parties accountable. If this applies to you, let’s talk.

"Behind the Scenes: A Personal Note 

A little transparency about what's been happening with Tim and I: the last few weeks have been a whirlwind of challenges, heartache, and moments of reflection that remind us how much we rely on the comfort of home. My elderly godfather was forced to evacuate his longtime home in Pacific Palisades during the recent Palisades fire, leaving behind a home of 65 years filled with countless memories, with just the clothes on his back, his medications, and his newly adopted Australian Shepherd, Jazz.

We’re incredibly grateful to have found him a one-story rental about 20 minutes from our home (thankfully, we know some amazing real estate agents ). It’s not the life he’s used to, but it’s a safe space where he and Jazz can start to rebuild their routine.

Adjusting to this new chapter has been far from easy. My godfather is very technically challenged, which makes even the simplest tasks - finding a new bank, post office, grocery store, or restaurants - a significant challenge. Tim and I have been doing our best to help him navigate - whether it’s communicating with his insurance adjuster, managing temporary housing, tackling paperwork, or just being there to listen.

He likes to “explore,” but it’s going to take time and patience to help him feel comfortable in his new surroundings. He’s retired and sometimes forgets that Tim and I are not, which has brought a few challenges as well!

As for his house, based on aerial views by CalFire, it appears to be still standing, but we still haven’t been let back into his community to confirm. It looks like most homes on his side of the block survived, but sadly, the other side wasn’t so fortunate, with many homes destroyed. His entire community - including businesses, restaurants, and doctor’s offices - has been devastated. Rebuilding will take years.

If you’ve experienced something similar or have words of encouragement, I’d love to hear from you. Your support means the world to us. ❤️

"Losing our family home in the Pacific Palisades fire has been the hardest challenge I’ve ever faced…

It’s testing every mindset shift I’ve ever spoken about - challenging my belief in resilience, community, purpose, and faith.

It’s easy to talk about these things when life is good.

But when everything goes to hell - when the real test comes - what do you hold on to?

Here’s what I’ve realized:

You don’t rebuild by focusing on the loss.

You rebuild by focusing on the possibilities that remain.

Because even in the darkest times, there is light.
In the love of family, the support of friends, and the kindness of strangers.

I’ve experienced this firsthand in ways I can’t even put into words.

Pain has a strange way of revealing purpose.

Loss can become the soil for new growth.

But it starts with a choice:

To see the bigger story.

To surrender - not in defeat, but in trust.

Trust that the future holds something greater than what was lost.

That’s why I’m sharing our story - because I know we’re not alone.

We need change. We need accountability. And we need each other.

If this resonates with you, please share it.

Let’s create the shift we need to see.

To everyone who’s shown us love, encouragement, and support - thank you.

You remind me every day that we are stronger together.

And truthfully, I’m not just sharing this for you - I’m sharing it as a reminder for myself.

What mindset, lesson, or perspective has helped you through life’s hardest challenges?

I could really use your insight right now

"#BreakingNews: All residents of the #PacificPalisades are now allowed to return to their homes for the first time since being evacuated amid the ravaging fire that erupted earlier this month. 

“Thanks to the tireless efforts of our public safety, public works, and utilities partners — as of noon all of the Pacific Palisades will be opened for resident re-entry,” said Los Angeles Councilwoman #TraciPark in a video posted to her Instagram account. “This is a watershed moment and I want to thank you all for your patience to allow these workers to clear major hazards.”

A stretch of #PacificCoastHighway along the Pacific Palisades will reportedly be reopened for resident-only traffic and residents will still need police escorts who can be found at Lot 3 for re-entry, according to Park. 

Residents will be allowed to return between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., however the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will remain in effect, said Park.

Unfortunately, there will be many residents who will return to a destroyed home.

"15 days down in Southern California on the Palisades Fire with a thrown together strike team of DNR engines. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to experience a historic and dynamic incident while representing Washington state. This assignment had a range of valuable experiences and challenges, some of which is your typical firefighting expectations, like mop up and gridding while others were more dynamic like, interacting with the media, and going from home to home turning off utilities and turning garbage cans right side up. I have never experienced seeing so much devastation, thousands of resources pooling in and supporting from all around the country, and the unsettling polarizing atmosphere of what had just occurred and the unknown timeline of domino effects that people affected by the incident will have to navigate. Fire in California is no joke, it’s been ripping there for as long as we know of and will continue to do so as long as the grass grows, naturally or human caused. I hope people will continue to acknowledge the importance of managing our forests health and the precautions to take when living in a fire prone wilderness urban interface. #dnrwildfire #palisadesfire #calfire #topanga",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFWdNNXPABn/,2025-01-28 01:30:10+00:00

"In the ongoing aftermath of one of the worst disasters in the history of Los Angeles, we seek to directly benefit the artists affected by the fires with an exhibition of their works, for which they will receive 100% of the proceeds. 

This exhibition idea began as a direct fire relief effort, but quickly evolved into an opportunity to share personal stories and artistic responses to this moment in our collective experience. The exhibition will include artwork pre- and post fires, interpretive and story telling wall texts by each artist, and a gallery talk with the artists on Saturday, February 22 at 2pm, moderated by Hannah Sloan in building F2 in Bergamot Station. 

The exhibition coincides with Frieze week. If you, or someone you know, is an artist severely and directly impacted by the fires, please share with us. 
PLEASE NOTE: This call is for working professional artists and due to limited space we will not be able to include all submissions.

"Thank you to everyone who has written, reached out, sent care packages, and wrapped me in your love. Today, I finally found the courage to return to what remains of my home. As I sifted through the ash, the occasional recognizable fragment surfaced—a memory, a piece of what once was. It was a delicate dance to stay upright amidst the devastation, but I found my balance, anchored by the strength of these words, lovingly written for me by my dear friend, Cathryn Castle.
""Through the Unthinkable: A Heartfelt Commitment and Promise to Walk Beside Me with Unwavering Friendship.""
I will sit with you in the ash and soot and we will paint our bodies black with the ashes of despair. We will scream until our lungs burn like the fire that raged through your home.
Then, when you are almost ready, I will take your hand and help you wobble to your feet. You will find your footing.
We will wash the soot away with tears. And the sea. We will bathe in hope. We will breathe in laughter and ease. And we will begin. Again.
You, a sparkly phoenix and me, your faithful Batgirl/Good Witch hybrid. We will rise. And soar. And the sound of our laughter will be heard throughout the land."" #palisadesfire #malibufire #malibustrong",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFXEgQYRy2E/,2025-01-28 07:13:33+00:00

The LemonAID sale was huge a success and it showed these kids the power of creativity and community. 

August and Harper are already talking about donating to their school (which also burned down) and to the Los Angeles Fire Department. 

I am so proud to be raising children who are thinking about helping others, even after they lost everything. 

It’s a true testament to how supported they must feel, thanks to friends, family, and kind people like you.

So thank you. Again.

"My first Neckmess pic since “the fire”.
“THE SIMPLE THINGS…where have they gone ?”
It’s not my beautiful view that I stood on every day and said the “mode Ani” morning prayer…
It’s not a necklace on my favorite rocking chair with a rose quartz heart that @noahmalibujewelry gave me.(gone)
It’s not the beautiful orange huckleberry flowers that the prettiest hummingbirds suckled from…
And it’s not the overgrown ivy that I actually loved so much as it made me feel cozy…
These “THINGS” are all connected to millions of memories that will never be again…
BUTTTT…I was touched by an angel yesterday as I stood out in the freezing morning air I could feel a kiss on my head…the way mommy would kiss me.
And when I looked at the phone sure enough a rainbow in the light……
And just like that I just know everything will be ok…one day…

Also, those who have reached out to me, and everyone, with your love and support so selflessly. This series of photos is just a reminder that this will be a long road and your constant support will be not only be needed but also received. 

if you’ve noticed, I’ve been a bit silent and removed from social media and only just returning back to California today, after being with my family for some reprieve. This catastrophe left an emotional scar etched in my mind. It deeply affected, not only my life, but my community’s, and so many friends and clients who did lose their tangible.  It broke a piece of my heart (as I’m sure it has done so many of you). 

nevertheless, life has proven to always be unpredictable, and full of the highest highs and the lowest lows. And if there’s one expression that I’ve always cherished it is the following:

“It’s not what happens to you, but rather it’s how you react to it”. 

Let’s try to be stronger, kinder and better on our good days…and on the more difficult days, let’s practice being softer, gentler and more patient with both yourself and others. ❤️

"Wassup Y’all, long time no see

2024 was a big year for a lot of us

Personally, I walked away from a lot of ppl & places I once called home

I went on a 10 month pilgrimage to 10 different countries visiting ancestral lands and other sacred sites around the world. 

Toward the end of my journey I entered my second Dark Room, diving into an 8 day immersion this time where I had a full life review & integrated a lot of the big lessons since 2020. Part of the intent was to land deeper clarity & focus for this next stage of my life 

I’m excited to share a new phase of works with the world & with my community 

2025 is the year where I will completely transition off of these social media spaces. Im also exploring where to publish a book i’m writing and which platform is most aligned for 27 unreleased songs from the last chapter. 

I made some of the best music of my life last year that I”m truly proud of.

So as this season shifts, as I integrate yet another “natural disaster” evacuation / displacement saga in the nomad journey

And after being with the land so intimately on this pilgrimage 

I really want to focus on who is right in front of me and to focus on those who truly value my presence in their life, those stepping into greater leadership, those wanting to dive deeper into their great work, those ready to co-create a more wholesome culture and serve from a deeply authentic place 

I’ve grown weary of the hyper-performative spiritual—dominantly priviliged circles, the wetiko ridden false-light “spiritual”-entrepreneurial and transformational scenes

Its been 20 years of initiations

I have refined, simple, powerful and good medicine for these changing times. 

Im done reaching, simply making myself avail for those of you that are seeing this and want to stay connected 

I’m still active on here (for now) but mostly excited about my off platform community I’m launching next month

If you want to be more connected in a way that matters, with content that matters, both the community and my Substack are 100% FREE

"On Sunday I was in the Palisades, capturing a moment that contrasted the raw beauty of nature with the haunting aftermath of destruction. Amidst the ashes, debris, and remnants of lives reduced to rubble, the ocean stretched out calmly under the glow of a breathtaking sunset. My heart is utterly shattered.

I’m caught in a bewildering reality, on one hand, I return home to a semblance of normalcy, but on the other, I witness the overwhelming devastation that has consumed others’ lives. It’s a stark and painful contrast that feels deeply unjust.

The tragedy extends beyond those who have lost their homes; it affects families like mine, who have lost businesses and livelihoods. The sense of helplessness is compounded by a government that seems incapable of providing the support and direction needed in such desperate times.

I am heartbroken, and I am angry. #PalisadesFire #CaliforniaWildfires #CommunityStrong #RebuildTogether #DisasterRelief #WildfireSurvivors #ClimateCrisis #WeNeedHelp #SupportSmallBusiness #HumanitarianCrisis #PrayForCalifornia

The fires here in our beloved Los Angeles these last few weeks have touched everyone, either through their own personal loss or that of those we know and love. We at LAFA were devastated to learn that one of our partners in the Free Billy campaign lost long-time partner, Arthur Simoneau. We had just seen Lisa Levinson of In Defense of Animals at our Vigil for Elephants where she spoke movingly for Shaunzi and all the other elephants in captivity who died in 2024. And now a mere days later, tragedy has struck her own life. We have been holding Lisa and Arthur's family in our thoughts. And all the others, both human and nonhuman, who are now gone or are suffering without homes or family members or cherished friends.  

From @ida_international: We don’t usually make personal requests, but this is different. Our beloved Campaigns Director, Lisa Levinson, has suffered an unimaginable loss. Her long-time partner, Arthur Simoneau, a hang-gliding pioneer and devoted advocate for animals and the environment, tragically lost his life in the LA fires. 

Lisa has dedicated her life to supporting animals and animal activists — now, it’s our turn to rally around her with love, compassion, and generosity. 

Here’s how you can help:

"3 weeks have passed since the historic wildfires of January 7th tore through hillside neighborhoods of Los Angeles. This is a resource created to help draw attention to the millions of dollars of direct contributions still needed to support families get through this time. 

Black, Latine, Filipino, and Disabled community organizers have compiled large directories of GoFundMe campaigns accessible to the public. If you’re able, please prioritize direct contributions to the accounts linked in the linktr.ee in my profile, and share widely. It can be overwhelming to decide how you want to contribute, but this may be your best bet at direct support.

the last slide was filmed on January 7th at 4:13pm ~ the fire in the palisades had started around 10:30 that morning but i hadn’t found out about it yet. 
i was enjoying the breeze from my balcony. i thought it was a beautiful thing and i wanted it to stay. it reminded me of the warm autumn winds i grew up feeling every year in my hometown. i never knew of the santa ana’s. wild, wicked, merciless winds. now i will never forget them.

"Looking Back: The Difference E49 Made in the Palisades
-
Eight days of relentless effort, pushing ahead of the fire, defending structures—it was impossible not to question whether our work was in vain.
-
The crew of E49, a Marine Task Force Engine assigned to the Port of LA, found importance in remembering addresses and locations where we had been tasked. It gave us a way to measure whether our efforts truly made a difference.
-
On the seventh day, we rotated back to the tactical area where it all began. As soon as the crew learned of this, they unanimously asked to check on the properties assigned to us on that very first night.
-
What we found was bittersweet. Entering the neighborhood, we were met with complete devastation—every home reduced to ash, except a few.
-
We started  the night by aggressively attacking a fire on the third floor of a 3 story apartment with a drop bag operation followed by rolling into a neighborhood with everything on fire around us. Making critical decisions in a short period of time became the main focus early in the evening. To our disbelief, it felt amazing to know several structure were still standing due to our efforts.
-
Amid the destruction, that lone house & apartment house symbolized hope. It was a reminder that our work, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem in the grand scheme, can make all the difference for someone else. For several families, everything they had worked for and cherished was still standing.
-
This is what drives every first responder. The gratitude, the thanks—we don’t do it for that. This is our calling, our mission, and our goal: to make a difference where and when it matters most.

"Now that the fires chilled out and everyone outside of LA is done having an opinion on the fires I took time out to see what was happening on the ground..

and what I caught was depressing. 

There was a big spotlight on the Palisades fire but Altadena was a place I could nearly call home. In my high school days me and the old crew would sneak into the “Enchanted Forest” in the middle of the night to look for ghosts and Satan worshippers lol. too bad we didn’t find any but it was still a place I would  take hikes up to Echo Mountain.. and now its all gone.

What’s left of Altadena looks like a warzone.. and it still smells like one. Even if your house held up you’re still living in an area thats pretty much uninhabitable for years.

I find it weird how you can drive 15 min from Altadena and the world moves like nothing’s happened. Everyone’s on the next “thing” while there’s people out here still picking up the pieces. The amount of virtue signaling around the fires has been insane. You have people outside of LA calling out people who live in LA for being silent about the fires in LA

Like bruh. Most of us (myself and fam included) were packing our shit and getting ready to move in case we got the evac warning. If the winds picked up any longer that Wednesday night my fam’s home would’ve went up in smoke too. 

If there’s anything that hasn’t changed through all that’s happened in Altadena its I still get stopped by the cops tho ‍♂️

TLDR: yea the world’s going to keep moving, but there’s still going to be people unpacking their shit. Not everyone moves on the same timeline. ️

"Palisades fire, January 2025

Three weeks ago, the Palisades fire started and tore through entire communities here in West Los Angeles. I had never seen anything like this in my entire life. Nor had most people here in SoCal. Unfortunately, this was the perfect storm. It has been the driest winter on record since 1964, and this particular Santa Ana wind event was the strongest since 1997. 

Everyone on the Internet has someone to blame for this tragedy, and while I agree, people need to be held accountable, once this fire started at 11 AM on Tuesday there was no amount of water that could have stopped it.

Thank you to the firefighters, first responders, and people of LA who have stepped up when its mattered most. You are our heroes ",212999109,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFYxteGydgV/,2025-01-28 23:07:49+00:00
"Last night, we attended the @saintsophiacathedral_la dinner event, “An Evening of Hope and Healing”, to benefit and honor the people and communities affected by the fires in Los Angeles county. His Eminence @archbishopelpidophoros of America, His Eminence Metropolitan Gerasimos of San Francisco @goarch , multiple clergy, and many other church leaders were in attendance, including the National and Metropolis Presidents of @philoptochos , several @archonsecumenicalpatriarchate , and representatives of the @ioccrelief . 

Their words of encouragement, hope, faith, and testament to God’s mercy and healing in the wake of disaster was inspiring. And their dedication to coming together to supporting our local Southern California community, even from all parts of the country, was truly touching. They shared their experiences going to the homes and neighborhoods affected by the fires, hearing the stories from the families affected, and the action the larger church has already taken, and is continuing to come together to take to support them. 

When one part of the Body suffers, all suffer together with it. This is Communion.

"Look at the difference 3 days makes  These little fire feet look so much better. Some people had asked how we were treating the burns and the short answer is that it’s individual to each patient. Pain management is a must. Treating or preventing secondary infection through antibiotics (topical vs systemic), gentle wound care. For more severe burns we have to add in monitoring of the body’s protein levels and may need to add in more aggressive treatments including skin grafts, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, etc. There’s no one-size-fits-all in medicine. Nuanced care allows us to address the unique needs of each patient as an individual. For this little guy, we controlled his pain, put him on systemic antibiotics, and when comfortable, we would soak his feet. Less was more in his case. #burn #palisadesfire #kitten #kittens #kitty #kitties #kittycat #kittensofinstagram",1.65278E+14,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFZgTaOREXx/,2025-01-29 05:54:57+00:00

"Three weeks ago…
.
Amy and I, along with Floyd, fled our home in a rush as fire evacuations were ordered. Now, three weeks later, outside of a quick drive-by early on with the CNN crew, I was finally able to visit my property. I’d seen it from the outside, so I knew what the devastation looked like (and smelled like). But today, clad in my dorky-looking PPE and ventilator mask because of how toxic it is, I was able to actually walk around the property and see everything close up. And I’m telling you, seeing my old home, the pool I threw my girls across, common areas I chased them around in, and even stairways where I’d share hello’s with my neighbors, all obliterated… that was something I will never forget.
.
I went with my good friend and neighbor Dave. He and his lovely family lived right beneath us for over a decade. They had the first floor, and our townhome had the two floors above them. We were a three-story property. Now his and my home are one brutally smashed together Akira-esque amalgamation. We knew we weren’t going to salvage anything, but we still went hoping to find something, anything, that could give us a little connection to our past. Unfortunately the roof had mostly collapsed on top of everything so even if there was something left, we couldn’t get to it anyway. I was able to step into the corner of what used to be my kitchen and laundry area, and saw the husks of my washer and dryer. But outside of a few magenta and blue colored plate shards, the burnt up remains of my recipe notebooks (you can still see the metal spiral clinging to the ash pages) and strangely, my Cuisinart mixer bowl (should be an ad campaign), I couldn’t see anything else.
.
It was a difficult day. Not unlike the last 21 days. But each week’s anniversary seems to have a new punch in the gut. I know this disaster footage is getting old for many of you. At three weeks most of you are fatigued of seeing this kind of stuff. But this experience isn’t temporary for us. It’s our lives now. And I’m going to keep reminding the world.
.
But onward and upward. Can’t only focus on what was lost. We’re gonna survive this mess, just like that Cuisinart bowl.

"Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? A few months ago we styled an AirBNB for a dear friend, @daniellamonet. Once the project was complete, we found out that short term rentals are not allowed in that particular area of LA. Several months later, LA was hit with the tragic wildfires and this home that we poured so much thought and love into, sat untouched, yet fully furnished and fully stocked. The universe had a plan and made sure that this home wasn’t merely a weekly rental, but was ready for a family in need. Our hearts are full knowing that a family who lost everything in the fires now resides here. It all happened for a reason. 

Huge thank you to the people who added extra heart and life to this project: 

@janamariepetrosini for equally pouring her time, energy, and soul into this home. 

@helmandoar for the absolutely stunning artwork. The quality of your pieces are unmatched.

"Los Angeles Closes Beaches Due to Fire Debris

Recent rain and fire debris have prompted LA County to issue a health advisory and close beaches from Malibu to Playa del Rey.

All LA County beaches are under a rain advisory until Thursday morning—stay out of the water for 72 hours after rainfall.
The public is advised to avoid beaches until further notice due to dangerous fire debris and pollutants.

Beyond the personal loss of our home and studio, we are devastated for the immense heartbreak this fire has brought our community. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this tragedy, especially those who have lost their loved ones, pets, homes, and treasured spaces. 

We are deeply moved by the incredible outpouring of love and support we have received from all of you. Your kindness, compassion, and encouragement have been a lifeline during this time of uncertainty. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for standing by us — your words, actions, and presence mean more than we can put into words.

With our physical space gone, we have paused all treatments for the time being. As we navigate these challenging times, we are committed to finding ways to give back to our community and create a safe space for connection, nourishment, and healing. We are also continuing to plan our Muse Retreat in Mallorca, Spain this spring — which feels more meaningful than ever. 

The journey ahead is uncertain, but we are grounded in the belief that together, we can rise stronger. Thank you for being part of our community. We are with you.

With love,
Kristina

"Jake and I visited our home yesterday and it felt surreal. Most of the house seems to have simply vaporized or turned to ash. Few things are standing other than our chimney, shower walls, and oddly enough, my nursing cart. We did find among the piles of ash a No Mess Serving Utensil and a steel rim that was embedded in a #soupercubes tray. After weeks of endless crying, seeing them somewhat survive the fire made us both laugh.

This week, I’m sharing more about how I’m doing since our house burned down in the #palisadesfire in my next Michelle’s Monthly. If you’re new here, I write a once a month newsletter sharing some personal and some work updates. It was supposed to go out last week but time doesn’t make sense this month so it’s going out this Sunday.

If you want to read it, I encourage you to sign up for our newsletter at soupercubes.com. 

Once I can pick myself up again, I’ll share more about products I’m working on, favorite recipes, and things I’m thinking about in my kitchen. I always read all responses and replies.

As always, I appreciate your kindness towards our family during this difficult chapter. Your support for our small business is something I’ll never forget.

-Michelle (Souper Cubes Cofounder)

Reopening feels great but also terrifying with so few customers in the community. Every shop and restaurant needs your support in the upcoming weeks and months to come. There’s no information from @cityofmalibu when pacific coast highway to and from santa monica will reopen and at what capacity/ number of lanes. This makes it impossible for residents, businesses, their employees and deliveries to plan for the near future. We may be right here but the journey the road ahead will be difficult .

We are going to start off with @kaidohouse  autographed diecast. Back in 2021 we met with Mr. Jun Imai (President and Chief Creative) of Kaido House and he was gracious enough to sign a few of the boxes of this collection. At that same time we were fortunate to meet and work with @sungkangsta as well. He also signed a few of the diecast as well and numbered them 1-8. We currently have 3 of them available to bid on. 
We noticed that Jun is going to donate to @pasadenahumane. We would like to piggyback and also donate to them when this auction has completed. The auction is currently live and will end on 02/28/2025. We will post our donations when all is said and done.  Please share.

"California Conservation Corps (CCC) crews are on the ground at Malibu Beach, working to protect local watersheds from fire debris and contamination after the devastating Palisades Fire. 

The fire, which scorched 23,000+ acres, destroyed 12,000+ structures, and forced 150,000 evacuations, left the region vulnerable to mudslides and runoff pollution. CCC teams from Tahoe & Solano are installing silt socks, straw wattles, and silt fencing to prevent hazardous debris from reaching the ocean.

️ The CCC, a state emergency response agency, has been on the front lines of disaster recovery for nearly 50 years, helping California communities rebuild.

" Price Gouging in LA After the Fires 

Following the recent Palisades and Eaton fires, some landlords and businesses are illegally raising prices on rentals, hotels, and essentials—this is called price gouging.

 What’s Happening?
With many displaced, demand for housing has surged, leading to rent hikes and inflated hotel rates.

⚖️ Is This Legal?
No! In California, raising prices over 10% after a state of emergency is illegal and punishable by fines or criminal charges.

 Know Your Rights
If you spot price gouging, report it to the CA Attorney General or local authorities. No one should profit from a crisis.

"Being in the structural, geotechnical and disaster business, you get sort of “used” to seeing massive destruction and the subsequent loss and emotion from your clients and their families. Some would call it desensitization, and I suppose it does exist to a degree. I didn’t realize I had it until today. 

For the first time in my career full of disasters, I was left speechless after doing a full day of damage assessments in Malibu and Pacific Palisades today. 

It was so hard going to these areas with my clients, seeing their loss, feeling their feelings after the devastation. But even in the wake of such destruction, they inspired me through their toughness and resolve. They aren’t giving up or backing down. They aren’t waiting for anyone to save them. They are intent on going back HOME. Now, the work begins…

"✨City of Angels✨ 

2025 started off so bright, so many firsts. And then the unimaginable happened. 

Even though there’s still so much uncertainty ahead - I am so blessed to find comfort and certainty that I am surrounded by people who are ready to help and advocate for those in need. It’s going to be a long road ahead and this is just the beginning….but We are Here.❤️‍ #EatonFire #PalisadesFire",8.59191E+14,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFb7H9ExarD/,2025-01-30 04:27:48+00:00
"And just like that.... it’s gone.

We manage several commercial properties in the Palisades area, but this one on Via de la Paz is the one I feel most connected to. A beautiful flex space consists of 10 retail and office units owned by a very generous and warm-hearted owner. This was our first commercial building in Palisades, and it’s one of the reasons I frequently drive through the area. Over the past 8 years since we began managing it in 2017, I personally handled the turnovers and leasing for all the units except for one, and we’re fortunate to secure wonderful tenants. 

 I’m forever grateful to you, Tangerine Alley! For all the real estate lessons, the wonderful people I’ve met during my showings, and for the 8-year Palisades tour. And to you, Palisades, I’ll be here to witness your recovery! #PaliStrong

"The gift of remembering …
My home was built not by my hands,
It was built with my heart.
I thought it lived within the reflections of what I owned, the beautiful things I collected, the wardrobe I wore and the ancient pottery I drank my ceremonial tea from. 
The fire MOVED me it didn’t burn me. 
It had me in a tornado of emotions 
And then yesterday as I dug for memories, I found this small plate that once lived on my daughter’s bedside table. 
This memory was all I needed to shift the heaviness I’ve been feeling. 
The reminder I needed.
A home isn’t the structure of the roof or the walls one hangs art. 
My home is in my heart, it’s been fed by each one of you that has reached out, known and unknown, each one of you who has something in their heart that felt me. YOU all lifted me up and guided my back to feeling loved, cared for, fed, housed, clothed, bathed and showered with generosity. 
Thank you 
I LOVE YOU.

"The fires broke out just as we were starting to head south towards L.A and I ended up covering some of the aftermath for @washingtonpost. 

It was deeply tender to step into and hold some of the grief that people are experiencing, and also beautiful to see the grassroots volunteer efforts that emerged: donation drives offering clothes, food and haircuts and church groups handing out food in affected neighborhoods. Allen Gharakhani of Glendale, who organized the drive at the Santa Anita Park (slides 5-7) did not expect it to turn into such a big resource. “We’re truly the city of angels,” he said.

Jimenez stayed at his home to fight the flames during the Eaton Fire and his home suffered damage but did not burn down. Ramirez had asked him if he could pray for him and Jimenez became emotional. “Prayer is our strongest weapon against hard times,” Ramirez said.

"My neighbors are going back…
Two have been greeted by their Buddhas…still shining their little lights.
I’m not ready…
Our architect went yesterday … I asked him to look for my menorah and my Shabbat candles …I told him where to search … he said”Tova, I’m so sorry for your loss I didn’t find anything.”

I’m not giving up …phase one entails the EPA going thru each home and giving the ok for debris removal…
According to my architect the president has ordered 1000 workers to  come out asap to begin this task….
After that we are permitted to begin stage Two-debris removal…
I think that will be when I go….
One of my neighbors went the other day in a full hazmat suit and passed out when she saw her home…
I get that…
Anyways, now we just wait…nothing is in my control only the way I react to NOT being in control.

Ty for being a part of my journey to rebuilding…

"Well, we finally went back yesterday. For closure, for companionship, and in some ways for absolute certainty - it’s all gone.

We laughed, we barely cried (tears have all but dried up at this point), we hugged, we thanked each other and thanked the space. Erin found a bill in the mailbox. I found a teacup. 

It’s truly impossible to find words to describe this entire experience. But what I can say is that I am so incredibly grateful for my community and my people - near and far. The outpouring of love and support I have not only experienced personally but have also witnessed for friends, colleagues, and all of Los Angeles has been amazing. Thank you thank you thank you to each and every one of you who has reached out and done so much more - notes are coming your way (one my new stationery gets here) but there really isn’t anything I can say to express how thankful I am or how loved I feel.

Re-reading Isiah 43:2 and continuing to Praise God for safety and all of my many blessings. And please please don’t get me wrong - I’m sad, I’m devastated, and some days I’m really really angry… but I’m still grateful.

PS If you’re still looking for ways to help, there is a link in my bio to donate to @puppiesandgolf - a charity very near and dear to my heart that is directly helping aid dogs (and people!) affected by the LA wildfires 

PPS I have no idea what the symbolism of this teacup and saucer means yet, but y’all know I’m gonna find something in it. It is now my most (and I guess only lol) prized possession. I’m taking it as a direct sign from Gingi and maybe that means some High Tea themed parties are in our future!?

They’ve now moved into community aid and resource outreach phase and DeLuis Guitars will be a central partner in this mission. Topanga Canyon is a magical place with a strong tie to historically iconic music, I’m proud to call this my community.

"January 2025 was supposed to mark the beginning of an exciting new chapter. After years of planning, my good friend and colleague, Dr. Matthew Muffly, and I were set to launch M|M Orthopaedics (Mehran & Muffly)—a boutique, high-end orthopedic practice overlooking the ocean in the Pacific Palisades. It was designed to serve our community and provide the specialized procedures we’ve dedicated our careers to mastering.

We faced countless challenges—navigating city regulations, overcoming legal hurdles, and ensuring every detail was perfect. After years of hard work, we were just days away from opening our doors.

Then, overnight, everything changed. A devastating fire swept through, destroying 70% of the city—significantly impacting our new practice, our investment, and our dream before it could even begin. On a personal level, my family lost our home and my in-laws’ lost their home, making this loss even more profound.

It’s easy to feel defeated, but I see an opportunity—an opportunity to show our kids, our patients, and our community  our strength and resilience. When I returned to the rubble, some of my closest friends showed up with protective gear and shovels, ready to help (pictured here). That’s when I knew: we will rebuild. And with a support system like that, we can’t fail.

Our dream is not gone, only postponed. One day, we will open our doors in Pacific Palisades. But for now, M|M Orthopaedics is operating from a temporary location: 2811 Wilshire Blvd, Suite 800, Santa Monica, CA. It may not be what we envisioned, but it’s home for now—and we’re still here to help you on your journey to recovery.

Thank you for all the love and support. We’ll see you soon!

"*** PLEASE SHARE *** We have all seen the images and footage of this fire and so many others. What we distantly view is nothing compared to what you feel when watching eyes survey what was once their everything. All was not lost, there are trinkets and trifles that are emerging from within the destruction. Most importantly, there are animals who have surfaced, some at their homes and some much further away.
Having driven, walked and seen first hand what was lost, damaged and untouched, I strongly believe Casper had opportunity to evade and escape. The easy ones have surrendered or have already been caught. Those that have survived are in such a state of unimaginable chaos they cannot possibly process our intention to help. This is why we do not call out, or pursue/follow/chase. This is also why we don't ""search"" for them. Their senses are heightened to a point greater than a truly wild animal.
When you see a yote roaming, or on camera look at the tail. If it's curled, it's our boy. He will be dirty, he will be flighty, 
This heartbeat needs to merge back in sync with that of his family and friends.
Just like his senses, my will and determination have been sharpened

I fully believe you're out there. Show yourself Casper, we'll get you home!

"“Rebuild” is a word that always unsettles me in the wake of catastrophic weather events and wildfires. It comes too soon, feeling reactive rather than making space for grief, fear, despair, and anxiety—emotions society is often so uncomfortable with. The urgency to set things right again takes priority, bypassing the depth of feeling that naturally follows such loss.

Questioning whether rebuilding makes sense in a climate crisis won’t stop the impulse to do it. But what if some far-flung outposts or deep canyons were left alone, so wildlife could reclaim them—free from roads, mansions, and the resources required to build them? That radical thought is rarely brought to the table.

Just as judgments fly about how people did or didn’t care for their pets in the fires, harsh words were also directed at those with the privilege to navigate disaster with relative ease. Yet as I walked through the ashes of homes in the Pacific Palisades and the hills of Altadena—past broken dinner plates and melted board game pieces—I felt the echoes of lives lived there.

Family gatherings, growing children, music, prayers, the joy of pets welcoming their person home. Sitting on the stoop of a house that no longer stood, I realized: losing one’s home, no matter its size, must be terrifying. The strangeness of standing at a doorstep before its residents even knew their home’s fate was haunting. The remains of lives laid bare felt vulnerable and tender.

I thought of my own father, unwilling to leave his island home in a hurricane after my mother passed, because it was where he belonged. Maybe rebuilding isn’t just about walls and roofs. Maybe it’s about keeping the flame of hope alive—that there will be a place to belong again, with loved ones and community. That isn’t reactive - it’s human.

If we rebuild in places prone to extreme conditions, we must do so with wisdom. Yet, before any physical rebuilding, there is an invisible one: the internal foundation laid at just the right time, in just the right place.❤️‍

"The remnants of a once idyllic neighborhood in Pacific Palisades. 1/11/25

This is the first time I’ve seen complete devastation on this scale. Ash and torched memories surround the one or two homes that were left standing, block after block. Chimney stacks and steel gates with addresses are the only clue to the fact that in December, folks were celebrating Christmas and preparing for a new year. I can’t imagine the feeling of loss they are enduring. Heartbreaking is putting it lightly. Jarring scenes like this shouldn’t happen, and we never think it will happen to us. It’s another reminder of how precious life is, and illustrates the fragility of our perceived stability. Words don’t do justice to the families affected and the lives lost due to the Palisades Fire.

"Woodside Firefighters Association Members Return from Palisades Fire Deployment

Three members of the Woodside Firefighters Association have recently returned after deploying with CA-TF3 to the Palisades Fire in Los Angeles. Their mission was to assist in search and recovery efforts for victims of the devastating wildfire.

We recognize the immense impact this fire has had on the affected communities, and our thoughts are with the residents who have lost so much. We stand in solidarity with our fellow first responders and all those working to help rebuild and recover.

"As the Eaton and Palisades fires subsided, many of you reached out to ask if the ash and residue falling across LA was hazardous to fruits and vegetables in backyard gardens. And TBH, we didn’t know.

So we reached out to Julia Van Soelen Kim, who is a Food Systems Advisor for the University of California. In 2017, she led the studies assessing backyard gardens after the Sonoma Complex Fires. She helped give us a bit of clarity + these 5 tips to follow when handling produce dusted by wildfire ash:

➡️ Protect yourself from smoke and protect your skin against ash. Wear an N95 mask outdoors and wear long pants & sleeves, gloves, hat and closed-toe shoes when harvesting.

➡️ Always wash your hands before and after harvesting and rinsing produce. If produce is completely covered in ash so no color is visible, discard it.

➡️ Gently pre-rinse your produce outside with a hose or bucket of potable water to remove visible soil and ash.

➡️ Before entering your home after gardening, remove your shoes and change into clean clothes. Bag smoky clothes and wash them as soon as possible to avoid tracking ash into and around your home.

➡️ Remove outer leaves. Rinse and rub produce under cool running water to remove soil, grit and ash. Wash your hands and peel produce before cooking or serving.

"Homesick. 

Lately, I’ve been reminiscing about all the beautiful memories we created in our Palisades home—the sunsets we chased to the beach, the simple dinners we enjoyed with our view of the Pacific, the parties filled with laughter, the morning I spent getting ready for our wedding, the quiet, ordinary moments I’m so grateful I captured… and even more grateful I got to live. I think about the meals I cooked in our kitchen, the entryway table that was always a little cluttered no matter how hard we tried, the baskets of laundry I never folded, the holiday gifts I never got to give. I remember practicing our first dance in the living room, belting Taylor Swift while Chris tried to sleep, sinking into the couch together after a long day to binge-watch The Sopranos.

The only way to describe how I feel is devastatingly homesick—for the life we built, the love we poured into every corner, the future we imagined there. The last few weeks have been full of tears, nostalgia, and, through it all, hope (thanks to my husband who has truly been my rock through all of this). I’m slowly adjusting to a new place, a new chapter, and while I’m beginning to feel optimistic, my heart still aches for everything we left behind and the future we were building there.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned from all of this, it’s how precious the seemingly mundane moments are (and how special it is to document those times). And that, somehow, even when it feels impossible, one foot will always go in front of the other and new plans will be made.

"Today was a sobering reminder of the power of nature and the resilience of those affected. This week marked the first time residents and their contractors could visit properties in the Palisades. I had the opportunity to assess a client’s home on their behalf, and while I won’t be sharing photos out of respect for their privacy, I can say this—it’s exactly what you’ve seen in videos and images, but experiencing it firsthand is something else entirely.

The smell of ash still lingers, muted slightly by recent rain. The eerie silence, broken only by minimal construction work, is chilling. Driving through the neighborhood, I saw firsthand how different construction materials impacted outcomes—one home completely lost, while its neighbor remained nearly untouched. It’s a stark contrast and a lesson in resilience, design, and preparation.

For those returning to their properties, my thoughts are with you. The road ahead will be challenging, but rebuilding is possible. If there’s anything I can do to support those navigating this process, I’m here.

"The EPA has decided to use the burned out lot at the bottom of Topanga Canyon Blvd. at PCH as a staging area for the toxic debris from Pacific Palisades. This potentially disastrous. I wrote the following to eight different people/ agencies.

While we understand the pressure on local officials to deal with the disaster at hand, we are deeply concerned that in haste another disaster could be in the making. 

The staging of toxic waste at the bottom of Topanga Canyon Blvd, Route 27 and PCH seems a very ill-conceived plan, and so far images of that area and it’s sloppy execution substantiates this concern. 

The proposed “sealing” of bags and barrels is meant to to protect this precious ecosystem and the inhabitants nearby, but we are seeing bags spilled open, and barrels ajar. 
The haphazard choice of this location and rushed execution of this staging has potential to poison people, the ocean, and sensitive lagoon habitat area ostensibly protected by the Coastal Commission. 

As business owners already affected by the disaster, the potential for damage to these locations seems inevitable, and could be enduring far beyond the foreseeable future. This location is critical for beach tourism, for local businesses, and for the survival of our community. 

Furthermore, it would be absolutely crazy to have the subsequent disposal of this waste travel by truckloads up the one of the most challenging roadways in the area, Route 27. We insist that this not be the plan. We ask you to relocate this waste sorting site to a non-populous, non-water adjacent site. 

Sincerely yours,

"It is with a heavy but hopeful heart I am writing this message. As those of you who know me personally, I lost my home and beautiful #malibu life in an instant on January 7. As we were evacuating, I decided to stop and make a batch of Muslix for neighbors. I did not know it would be my last batch made in Malibu, for now. And everything in the photo, including the cutting board and all, is gone. Burned. Up in flames. With it my budding business has been on halt. Our customers were all neighbors and now neighbors have lost homes and we have all been dispersed. But we will not give up, and we will not quit. Be patient and we will soon be operating out of Santa Monica until we can make our way back to Malibu. Delivery is still Malibu, Santa Monica and sadly with Palisades largely gone, we will extend to Marina Del Rey. So let’s say, between Marina del Rey and Malibu as long as it’s not too far from the beach. The beach always makes me smile. And as we know - our goal is to make love, kindness and health contagious - so let’s keep making smiles!!! #palisadesfire",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFeEfJMy8sI/,2025-01-31 00:28:05+00:00

"The wildfires that tore through Pacific Palisades and Altadena are expected to intensify the housing crisis in Los Angeles. Renters are likely to feel the impacts, with soaring rental prices after the Lahaina, Maui wildfire in 2023 acting as a cautionary tale for LA.

Many LA renters are already struggling, and tenant advocates say more action is needed to prevent a potential wave of evictions in a city where housing is among the most unaffordable in the nation and more than 70,000 people are unhoused. 

Here is a round-up of the few measures leaders in the city and county of LA are taking to strengthen laws in favor of tenants, along with a few they have rejected or delayed. We've also included measures that tenants advocates are currently rallying around.

"Meet Ridges, a brave cat rescued from the Palisades fire. He arrived at Palms & Paws with burns that needed attention, and one of our wonderful doctors performed a small procedure to remove the damaged skin. Ridges’ spunky attitude made the recovery process a bit bumpy. 

Despite a few challenges along the way, he is now healing well—- and the best part? He’s been reunited with his brother Ruffles. We’re so happy to see Ridges making progress and are grateful to be part of his recovery journey!

"A harzardous waste site for all of the hazardous and toxic waste from the Palisades fire is being set up by the EPA at Topanga Beach parking lot across PCH. The largest disaster to ever hit LA. Debris from 5000 structures from homes to gas stations and grocery stores….It’s expected that 75,000 truckloads of hazardous will be brought in and out. This is irresponsible at best. This temporary toxic dump site would be set up next up on sacred indigenous burial and cultural site, next to our creek, lagoon, river mouth, surf break and beach. The gridlock expected  would be huge, at the edge of a 1 lane road we use to commute and evacuate…please share and sign the petition.

"My Grandfather, Pops, was a WWII vet. He didn't speak of the war, but he always told me ""travel is the best education"". Today, I understand why he didn't speak much about what he saw during the war. However, I hope these images help you travel to the warzone that is the Palisades, and provides just a glimmer of what poor leadership can cause. I hope you cringe at the fact that the LADWP building is still standing, and I hope these images remind you of what our sitting politicians did to this incredible place. Lack of water, firemen and police don't just hurt the Palisades, it puts every single Angelino at risk. The fact that @mayorofla hasn't resigned out of sheer guilt and shame is astounding to me. Tonight, I pray that the tears of my friends and family, who have lost so much, are less, and I will pray the voters in this City and State stare at these photos, put their Blue and Red Jerseys in their drawers, stop fighting, and start rooting for a new type of leader, one that channels grace from God, strength from all the people, and Wisdom that supercedes the most advanced AI machine we have to-date. It's time for CA and LA to be reborn. #rebuild #reborn #resign #palisadespatriots #palisadesfire #palistrong #warzone #leadership",289490939,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFepUgixa0F/,2025-01-31 05:49:57+00:00

"Me: ""I can't wait to do my thing in 2025!""

2025: "" GIT DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW! SHUT UP! GIMME YOUR PURSE! GIMME YOUR SHOES! GIMME YOUR DRESS! GIMME YOUR DIGNITY AND EGO! YOU BET NOT MOVE! DON'T FUGGIN MOVE! I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL BLOW YOUR LITTLE  BALD HEAD CLEAN  OFF YOUR SHOULDERS!""

My looks from the 1st week in January! The rest of the month, I was running for my life, starring out the window, estate planning, and wondering if I have enough money for my sister and family to bury me properly. Like, how much would it cost to get my body from LA to Pennsylvania to get me in the ground with my Dad. I need better insurance. What insurance did my Dad have? Let me call my sister. Omg! All these fires and earthquakes here in LA!  I want my funeral in a real church; not a ""Christian Center"" I hope my family can get me in Calvary. 
Googles: Dead body shipping costs!

 I should eat today and bathe..Instead I slept til 4p almost daily. My God. The revenue loss! The people in #Altadena, the little baby ice skaters, must have been so cold! Omg will my Mom have social security. Hurricane Helene was brutal in her neck of the woods. I deserve this shot of whiskey. Oh, wait. Let me read the book Revelations again! Maybe I'll grow my hair out this year. Nah It's probably white! Get it together. Nina Simone would not be happy with you right now! FIGHT GRANT! FIGHT

"While covering the aftermath of the Palisades fire, I was walking around a street of a mobile home park that was completely destroyed when a flash of color caught my eye. I walked over to a tree, unfurled the paper and stood there stunned. A piece of paper that read “Love,” which looked like it had been ripped from a magazine, was literally the only thing in my sight (except brick) that appeared to have survived the flames. I considered that it had been put there after the fire burned, though the edged were singed and the nails looked like they had been there a long time.

"At first, I didn’t write this as a social media post.

I wrote it because I needed to.

Because healing isn’t just about forgetting - it’s about fully accepting what is. 

I was writing down the things I miss. The things I didn’t realize were the things until they were gone. 

And as I sat with it, something shifted.

Not just that the little things… were never little.

But alongside loss, a feeling of growing gratitude. Gratitude that those moments even existed. That they’re more alive than ever in my memory today.

If you’re in a season of loss, hold onto this: what you have right now - the things, the people, the routines, the simple joys - these are the things! 

And for those not navigating the same season right now, don’t wait until they’re gone to realize it.

Thank you again to this community for walking with me through this chapter 

Your support has meant more than you know. ❤️

"January 7th, 2025 - Scenes from the Deck

A slow day turned into a scrambled hellish nightmare, and in its wake, a ruin of dreams.

Somehow, my place survived, surrounded by carnage on both sides. After two previous false fire evacutions, I thought surely the third time's a charm. I feel lucky but stuck somewhere in purgatory mentally. 

I'll miss my neighbors, I'll miss my old neighborhood, but change (sometimes forced upon us violently) is inevitable, and we are not immune to it. The future of my residence is uncertain (although I'm hopeful), but I feel lucky to have been able to enjoy this community for the past 13 years. I've documented a lot of the effects of the Palisades fire on Malibu this month, but even as a form of catharsis, sharing after a tragedy never sits well with me and it's depressing as hell to view, so I'll see how to respectfully do so. In the meantime, I am ready to help rebuild my town, and I'll end it with some of the beauty of the landscape. I'll be adding a highlight section for the Palisades fire. Images/video I captured and info will be posted there as a bookend for the start of a new era.

Finally, make sure to hug a first responder when you see one and thank them for their service.

"Part 2: Pacific Palisades. Emily Bloom and her nieces salvage what they can from the fire which destroyed her home of 39 years...some cast iron and stainless steel pots, tools from her medical practice, and her daughter's miniature teapot. At another home, a magazine page with a photo of Bob Hope and Ginger Rogers peeks through the burnt ground, and a crew of firefighters and 'sawyers' from Aurora, Colorado inspect a tree which was recently cut down. On a hilltop overlooking the Canyon, a firefighter named Trevor recovers rare coins, while next door, Joel Frechette, 75, leaves his cousin's home before dark falls.

"How Will the LA Wildfires Impact Malibu Real Estate?

Wildfires are a recurring challenge for Southern California, and Malibu’s coastline is no exception. For buyers and sellers, understanding how wildfires impact real estate listings in Malibu is crucial for making informed decisions.

Heightened Fire Risk Awareness
Frequent wildfires have made buyers more cautious about properties in Malibu. 
- Location & Vegetation: Buyers value properties with cleared perimeters and fire-resistant landscaping.
- Fire Zones: Malibu’s ""high fire hazard severity zones"" affect insurance costs and buyer confidence.
- Defensible Space: Buyers prioritize homes with buffer zones that reduce fire spread.

Insurance Challenges
Insurance for Malibu properties has become more expensive and harder to secure.
- Rising Premiums: Costs have surged, with some premiums doubling or tripling.
- Limited Coverage: Many insurers restrict policies or withdraw from high-risk areas.
- Fireproofing Requirements: Buyers may need to install fire-resistant siding, heat-resistant windows, or sprinkler systems to qualify for coverage.

Impact on Property Values
Wildfires create both challenges and opportunities for property values.
- Short-Term Decline: Properties in affected areas often see temporary dips in value.
- Long-Term Recovery: Malibu’s desirability and limited inventory typically lead to value stabilization as safety measures improve.
- Luxury Market: High-end homes with advanced fire-resistant features retain value and attract discerning buyers.

Wildfires also affect Malibu’s environment and economy:
- Air Quality: Smoke and ash impact health, influencing buyer perceptions.
- Rebuilding Costs: Rebuilding often exceeds insurance payouts, raising financial concerns.
- Local Economy: Wildfires disrupt tourism and transportation, impacting market trends.

Despite these challenges, Malibu remains a coveted market with a resilient luxury segment. By understanding wildfire risks, prioritizing fire-resistant features, and staying informed, buyers and sellers can confidently navigate the Malibu real estate market.",8.61091E+14,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFgKgZHqyPO/,2025-01-31 19:59:31+00:00

"Last night was an experience I will never forget. It was filled with more emotion than I’ve felt in a very long time, and that’s saying something because I can be one hell of an emo son of a bitch. But being able to attend the @fireaidla show with such incredible row 2 seats, after being so graciously gifted them by some phenomenal people, was something truly special.
.
Every image we saw carried weight. Every story connected. Emotions and tears overflowed. Especially when we saw the Miles Teller segment dedicated to OUR condo complex, with a photo of our former home filling every screen in the @intuitdome. Unreal. 
.
I have a million words, yet most won’t come. I have a million memories of the almost SIX hour night, yet I’ll just let a few of the photos tell the story. And yes, if you scroll to the last photo, you’ll see that Paulo really loves Olivia Rodrigo, so he needed a memory with her. 
.
The whole thing was devastating, yet beautiful. Complex, yet cathartic. Heartbreaking, yet hopeful. In a way, just like Los Angeles.

More than ever, I love you LA. I really do.

"• I’ve spent my career creating houses for others and was lucky enough to build one for my own family. I may not be able to live there for awhile but what I’ve learned is that a house doesn’t make a home.  It’s the family, friends and love you fill it with that make it feel like the place you want to return to always. My friend took these images last night before @fireaidla to make me laugh bc I MATCHED the white leather fringe chairs in my rental.  I got to enjoy a sunset with a few of my favorite people and @fireaidla was the first time we all got to laugh, cry and be together as a community once again.  For all those displaced and those who lost it all, we are in this together and will be here to support new beginnings for all.  I can’t say it hasn’t been strange to have a whole new life overnight, but if we can’t find the silver linings, we won’t survive it.

"Losing everything in the Palisades fire has changed me. I’m not quite sure how yet, but I feel different. It’s hard to put into words.

We recently visited the remains, sharing a couple of iPhone photos. It’s been a few weeks since losing our place. It still feels unreal. I think maybe the hardest part is losing a sense of home. It’s disorienting.

When we evacuated, I don’t think anyone expected such a disaster. Every day, we remember something that’s gone. I’ve always been someone who values minimalism, skeptical of how people tend to accumulate endless stuff, but losing everything overnight is on another level.

Now I’m here, sitting with this strange mixture of loss and a forced shift to redefine what’s important. I think my habit of always challenging myself helps me look forward, even when it would be easy to feel hopeless.

Most of us have plans and ideas for our lives. We feel so sure of things. But something inevitably happens out of nowhere and makes us look like fools for thinking we knew the future.

The thing is, none of us knows what lies ahead. We haven’t been where we’re going. This is how it always is. Maybe that’s the beauty of life, if we can manage to see it along the way.",1.61735E+14,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFga-R5SthF/,2025-01-31 22:23:03+00:00

"This is updated information from the City of Malibu:

1/31/2025 - UPDATE FROM CITY OF MALIBU ADDRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT THE EPA'S PALISADES FIRE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TEMPORARY STAGING AREA AT TOPANGA AND PCH

The City is aware of community concerns we’ve heard about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s fire cleanup efforts and the use of the former Topanga Motel site on Pacific Coast Highway as a staging area. We know that this is an emotional time for our community, and want to provide clear, factual information about what is happening and what this means for Malibu.

The EPA is currently conducting Phase 1, hazardous materials cleanup following the Palisades Fire. This is an important first step in helping residents return home safely and quickly while protecting the environment, including our streams and oceans. During this Phase 1, EPA teams are going into the burn footprint and carefully removing hazardous household waste — things like propane tanks, paints, batteries, and household chemicals that need to be properly handled. The Topanga site is only for the first Phase materials — burn debris removal in Phase 2 will bypass this site entirely and go straight to disposal.

Because of the size of the impacted area, the White House has directed the EPA to complete this work in 30 days — something that would normally take six months to a year. To make that possible, the EPA has deployed over 1,000 personnel and 60 teams to get the job done quickly and safely.

The Topanga site is a staging site, not a disposal or storage site. Teams are temporarily bringing collected materials to the Topanga site, sorting and repacking them safely, and then promptly transporting them out of the area for final disposal. All of this activity is following strict federal guidelines.

This Topanga property is outside the Malibu City limits and is owned by California State Parks and has been authorized for use by the State. That decision was made without consultation with Malibu or advance notice. We understand this site was chosen because it is within the burn area and has the space needed to safely manage operations.",736181328,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFgdTdpytZO/,2025-01-31 22:43:26+00:00
"✨A community that cares ✨ 

A bake sale was organized by Katherine Owens to help bring the Arden Park community together to support fellow Californians in a time of terrible struggle and loss in the aftermath of the LA fires. Katherine reports that many people made baked treats and donated time and money to make the sale a hit, adding that local youth made a major impact on the success of the event by stepping up to assist. The bake sale raised more than $1,400, and the funds were split between two worthy organizations, the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation and the Pasadena Humane animal shelter.

This unprecedented destructive event occurred at the same time as other major fires around LA, including the 23k acre Palisades Fire that destroyed over 6000 structures. The Eaton Fire eventually burned over 14k acres into Angeles National Forest. Wildland urban interface and many more diversely populated neighborhoods are completely altered, whole blocks in ruins.

"She is bruised, she is broken, she is blistered AND she still stands! We are well aware that we are the minority here and that we came very close to losing our home at least 3 times that we concretely know of, probably more over the course of the fire. 

It takes seconds to destroy and ages to heal. But we will heal. We will clean, we will clear, we will regroup, we will  repair, we will mourn, we will grieve, we will yell at the sky, we will cry. We will laugh, we will sweat, we will work, we will organize. We will slowly, surely and with steadfast concentrated endurance recover. 

Most of all we will help our neighbors and community who did not return to their home still standing. To drive through our community was harrowing, surreal, tragic and otherworldly. 

Yet she stands! Thank you to all of you who kept us and our home in your prayers, your hopes, and your thoughts. We love the palisades so much! This has been home for 45 years and it will continue to be.

"HUGE thank you to everyone who supported the mission to get some warm meals to firefighters, volunteer firefighters, law enforcement, and military during the Palisades Fire incident. 

Together with the support and generosity of VME, Post 43, Chick-Fil-A Hollywood store 2703, we were able to give 80 meals out just on this one trip…they barely fit in my car ha! Big shout out to Karen Kraft who was instrumental in getting the meals through her networks: Dave Meadows, Jeremiah, Julian, Sergio. Gratitude to Brian, Tony, Abe, Tim, and new Post Auxiliary member Amanda, for their willingness to support this mission as well. Another thank you to Paris for helping me drop off necessities to be delivered to those affected by the fires. 

It’s times like these when we see the blessings of God’s grace and goodness flow through caring people who want to help the best they can. Thankful for all the volunteers from Post 43, it was encouraging to see how many people showed up to help and how well organized the op was. 

It was a joy to deliver these meals to the Woodland Hills Fire Department Station 84, Law Enforcement and National Guard personnel working the barricade check points going into Malibu, my station at MRCA, my brother’s Joint Task Force Rattle Snake crews who were attached to the Palisades incident for Cal Guard Type 1 IA hand crews working wee hours into the night providing critical structure protection in Topanga Canyon ‍

"Such deep gratitude for our firefighters—career, incarcerated, and community—along with all first responders and everyone working tirelessly to keep our communities safe. 100% containment in LA ❤️ Let’s continue to hold one another, support those affected, and stay prepared.

 The rain is a blessing, but experts say the air, water, and land will remain highly toxic for the next 1-2 years. This isn’t over.

 This is a marathon. We have the opportunity to create a new normal—one rooted in kindness, volunteering, and collective care in a way that is long-term and regenerative. Follow accounts like @iolovesyou for education and @the_kindnesshub for support, services, and community.

 FOLLOW WIND PATTERNS & WEAR A MASK. Toxic gases and heavy metals are still present and will be until proper remediation is complete. There is no safe distance. Keep windows and doors closed for the foreseeable future. Detox regularly, run an air filter always, and advocate for tech that can measure air toxicity countywide.

This is our new normal, but we don’t have to accept generations of health issues and cancer. Let’s stay aware and take care of ourselves. ❤️

"Thank you firefighters! 

While the #PalisadesFire has dominated the headlines over the past month, #YourLAFD has relentlessly battled multiple incidents, working all over our city and beyond to protect lives and property.

From the Hughes Fire in Castaic, to a grass fire in Mission Hills, the Kenneth Fire, and countless commercial and residential structure fires, crews have been on the frontlines day and night. These images capture just a glimpse of their dedication and bravery.

A huge thank you to our firefighters for their unwavering commitment.

"....
On that fateful night, even our safe haven didn't feel entirely safe. We tried to take separate watches, though at some point in the wee hours it became clear that the fire had run into the burn scar of the Franklin fire of three weeks before, ran out of breath, and decided to stop chasing us. Why not, it had already won.

"This is what resiliency looks like! 

Only 3 weeks+ after the Palisades Fire took my home and all my stuff, I’m blessed to be in a new place and settled — and tbh it looks like I’ve been living here for a while already lol. ❤️‍

We talk about Yoga and how it empowers us, supports us, heals us, and transforms us, but the real lessons often come off the mat. At USC, we’re scientifically studying my Yoga Teacher Training — which got moved back to Summer 2025 — analyzing a YTT’s effect on lifestyle and preventive medicine metrics like leadership, quality of life, physical/mental/emotional health, and resiliency. ❤️✌️

But, this is what those academic studies look like in the real world! This is what we practice for, so we can be in alignment, focused, and resilient when we need to be. 

In the past 3 weeks, I’ve done FEMA…filled out insurance forms…got deposits from my Palisades building…moved to a new place (set up internet, insurance, mail, etc)…organized an Amazon Wishlist Love Fest so people could share good vibes with my new home…ohhh and I only missed 1 day of work at the clinic AND 0 days of work teaching at USC! ❣️❣️❣️

Sometimes it’s hard to quantify the effects of a Yoga practice, but hopefully this does a lil. I’ve also cried lotsa tears and even went to Ojai this week to see my therapist to make sure I’m not bypassing. Just doing what my teacher Chet used to call, “The Work.” Scroll thru the pics and vids to check it all out. ️

And for anyone still stuck in and going thru the trauma, I see you, I feel you, and I hope to cross paths with you and hug you soon as well. Please reach out if I can help! ‍⚕️‍♂️

Wishing you a resilient day whatever challenges you’re facing. May we all go through it as gracefully as possible. ✨

DRONE Operators you should read. 
“This defendant recklessly flew an aircraft into airspace where first responders were risking their lives in an attempt to protect lives and property,” said Acting United States Attorney Joseph T. McNally. “This damage caused to the Super Scooper is a stark reminder that flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations. As this case demonstrates, we will track down drone operators who violate the law and interfere with the critical work of our first responders.”

“Lack of common sense and ignorance of your duty as a drone pilot will not shield you from criminal charges,” said Akil Davis, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “Please respect the law, respect the FAA’s rules and respect our firefighters and the residents they are protecting by keeping your drone at home during wildfires.”

"So I attended the FireAid concert on Thursday night. It was a wonderful way for the benefit to raise money for the families who lost everything. One thing about this city is how so many people rally to help each other. 
So many legendary performances and collaborations that blew my mind. From Greenday and Billie Eilish performing Last night on Earth, Anderson.Paak bringing out Sheila E. To drum solo, and then he brought out Dr. Dre to sing Still D.R.E and then California Love. Another amazing moment was when The Black Crowes brought out Slash to perform Going to California.  
Then Joni Mitchell graced us with her voice. Steven Stills and Graham Nash sang Teach your children well.
But my favorites were No doubt, Stevie Nicks, Pink  and the Nirvana reunion. Listening to Stevie Nicks perform Landslide as a tribute to the fire fighters had me in tears. And Pink's acoustic set was amazing! And my all time Fav No Doubt's energy was contagious! And the Nirvana performance of All apologies with Violet singing while her dad played drums was perfection. This entire night was so iconic LA and one I will not soon forget!!
This is why I adore This city! #Lastrong #LA #fireaid #wewillrebuild #musicisgoingtosavemysoul #palisadesfire #eatonfire #nodoubt #Pink #greenday #nirvana #stevienicks",214769240,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFjID3kyHMW/,2025-02-01 23:35:31+00:00
"I’m so grateful to have been able to help families celebrate the birthdays 20+ little ones who have been displaced by the Los Angeles wildfires. All we wanted to do is spread love, offer a little joy in the middle of tragedy and support our fellow Angelenos. I’m so thankful to have these baking superstars (and now friends!) that joined in the effort with me that collectively became known as “The Birthday Cake Project”. We saw a handful of other bakers start their own projects like this and we couldn’t be happier that the baking community showed up like this for our communities. We’re also super thankful that @amoderndetail offered to make beautiful custom cake toppers, @confettiandsprinkles offered to make as many fun balloon bouquets as she could and @tehachapigrainproject offered to support with ingredients if needed. @wiltoncakes even said they’re sending us a box of goodies to use for these cakes and we can’t wait to see the fun stuff they’re donating! 

We have met so many lovely people through this project. Los Angeles might be one of the biggest cities in the world, but it sure does feel small in the best way sometimes. 

Please continue to spread the word about The Birthday Cake Project - we’d love to continue supporting families in celebrating their kiddos during all this.

"Was January the longest month in history, or was it just me? ‍⏳ I swear I aged 10 years in 31 days…and let’s just say Dry January didn’t stand a chance 

Outfitted by @target, this was the first outfit I bought after we lost everything. Normally, I would have just gone for black, but for some reason, I felt like I needed something memorable—an outfit I’d always remember wearing on that day. After everything we’ve been through, I don’t think I’ll ever let it go.

Earlier that day, I saw a post from a woman who lost her home in the Woolsey Fire. She wrote about the immediate aftermath:

“You’re going to be in shock. Nothing will make sense. And when you panic shop for clothes, you’ll probably look back and think, ‘Why did I buy that outfit in that color?’ or ‘I grabbed six pairs of Spanx but zero actual clothes.’ Fire makes your world messy, and it will stay that way for a while. There’s nothing that can erase the loss. But over time, you’ll feel glimmers of hope, and the mess will become a little less.”

We have such a long road ahead, but I know we’ll get through it ❤️‍",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFjVkxEJGHZ/,2025-02-02 01:33:36+00:00

Mommy is devastated. So am I. So many paw parents lost everything. So many of our friends and family . So many fur babies… gone. 

I’ve run on Dog Beach, but nothing was ever like my beach. Will I ever feel Big Rock’s sand under my paws again?  The ocean breeze? Mommy always said I could run like the wind here… and I did. ❤️

Walking to our @moonshadows_malibu, seeing everyone there who have become family….it will never be the same. One day, maybe, but different. 

We prayed here.  I felt alive here. ❤️ I ran like the wind here. ‍♀️ I even got hurt here.  There’s nothing like living on our Big Rock Beach, Malibu. 

I love you, THE BU, for every memory….until I can live back on our beach

"Imbolc. February. 2025. We land on this sabbat that venerates fire and water just as there are finally no active fires in the region. As of last night, the final night of this very long experience of January…No more active fires in Los Angeles. (I needed to type it again just to read it again, to try to take it in.) I feel mournful relief. 

Needless to say, I do not feel called to light a candle or anything that burns in honor of this midway point between the winter solstice and vernal equinox. But I’m taking a moment to think about the Celtic celebration of this time, and how it marks the beginning of healing, of moving out of darkness, toward the light.

Moving forward is going to look so different for each person who has lived through this time here. It’s going to look different across the country as we begin to deal with the very real and dangerous repercussions of that person being sworn in on the 20th. 
There is so much work involved in moving forward in any way, and I just want to remind you, in case you need it, that there is room for your hope and your sorrow in the same moment. They are not at odds with one another - they honor your existence and experience in this world. 
I’m sending Love to each of you, tonight and always.

"I followed my heart and it led me to LA ❤️

Who knew serving smoothies to first responders would change our lives. I think universe did. We had no plan. Just flew out to see where we could help. Everything fell into place and we somehow ended up on PCH at the first responder headquarters with all the utility workers and npos and @lapdhq @usarmy @losangelesfiredepartment with the help of @wckitchen and @gordohibachi (who deserves his own post). It was inspiring to see all the different branches working together. It felt good to say all day, “Thank you for your service. We’re proud of you.” I honestly felt like I was saying it on behalf of the world, humanity, the people. They’ve been there since Day 1 of the fires, January 7. I’ll never forget that day. It felt like I was seeing hell in heaven. My heart still hurts thinking about it. So being there with everyone on the ground working day in and day out…it was like a gathering of angels. Tired hungry angels. I often called them working kings. You could see the drain in their eyes despite their beautiful smiles and strong bodies. Every single human we met out there was beautiful. Bright light and beautiful. My heart is so full. Don’t mind me, the next few hundred posts may be from this week. Thank you to the friends and family who donated to this trip. Seriously, they freaking LOVED the green smoothies. We passed out thousands. Apple, kale, banana smoothies (recipe courtesy of @arnoldsway) all day everyday. Some of them would stand near the table and just keep getting topped off. Everyone became a regular. They all kept saying they hadn’t seen a fresh green anything in weeks. It was the easiest service that created A LOT of happiness. I feel lucky to have been a part of it all. Trust the universe. Trust love. Hold plans loosely. Let the flow take you to the levels higher than you can on your own.

"Rising from the Ashes: A Journey of Loss and Hope Resurrected
On January 7, my home was reduced to ash in the Malibu fires. Everything—every carefully preserved memory, every object infused with history—vanished in an instant.
One of the losses I wrote about was a piece of ancient pottery, a 2,500-year-old Zapotec vase. I called the post ""The Caretaker"" because that is what I had been—its guardian. It had been entrusted to me decades ago, given with love and trust, and I had believed it was my duty to protect it. And yet, in the fire, it was destroyed. I grieved not just the loss of the artifact but the story it carried. I felt I had failed it.
But the story did not end there.
When I finally returned to what used to be my home, I had ambitions of recovery. I wanted to sift through the wreckage, to find something—anything—that had survived. But when I arrived, I was utterly paralyzed. The scale of destruction was beyond anything I could have prepared for. I stood there, overwhelmed, incapable of action. I found a few scattered remnants, but mostly, I found myself lost in the weight of what was gone.
And then, there was Jay Ireland.
He saw my collapse, my inability to do what I had set out to do. And so he went in my place. Every day, he returned to the site. (I had been banned) With nothing but a small brush and a quiet determination, he sifted through the ruins, searching for anything that had survived.
One day, he returned with a handful of small beads—he did not know it, but they were the ones that had been nestled inside my precious vase. I was overwhelmed. It was a gift beyond measure, proof that some fragments had endured. But Jay wasn’t finished. The next day, he arrived at my door with a grin stretched across his face.
He had found it.
The 2500-year-old clay Zapotec vase. Buried under four feet of ash, scarred but still whole. There is a small penetration, a wound from its battle with the fire, but otherwise, it is intact. Can you believe it? The very artifact I wrote about, the one so many of you mourned with me, survived. More Below...

"Thankful for a new day and for the challenges ahead that I pray I will learn and grow from. 

As PCH reopens to the general public this morning, I hope people remember that thousands of residents here are mourning the loss of their homes and neighborhoods. Please be respectful when driving through Malibu. Yesterday I saw a couple sobbing in the middle of an empty lot and another elderly man just leaning against his car, staring at what used to be his home. Locals were only allowed back a couple of days ago and are still processing the loss. 

I’m happy that the local businesses we know and love will get a much needed boost from the opening. I understand how crucial this is to the healing journey for everyone. Hoping this can coincide with keeping everyone who lives here safe, secure, and with a sense of dignity while grieving their losses and beginning the long road back to rebuilding or repairing their homes and lives. 

Sending peace and love to all my friends, coworkers and neighbors who’ve been affected by the #FranklinFire, #EatonFire & #PalisadesFire. ",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFkwhBGJ_-p/,2025-02-02 14:48:16+00:00

"Packing up my dreams temporarily 

Recently, we had the opportunity to go in The Palisades and see our office. I would like to share that the interior of the office is in good status and the building sustained minimal damage. We are hopeful that sooner than later we will be able to go back in and resume our workflow.

In the meantime, we have set up a satellite office in Brentwood in order to continue providing the best dental care for our patients. 

Thank you to all my patients for the continuous support and to my team for the constant help. I feel so blessed to be surrounded by such amazing people while we navigate this difficult time. 

We will come back from this stronger!

"We went back Thursday.  Driving down Sunset, seeing so much destruction seemed so unreal, like being stuck in a bad disaster movie on Ground Hog’s day (which by the way was yesterday). 

What was once a street with beautiful homes and countless shops that I drove down at least several times a day for the last 17 years, was no more.  Hardly anything recognizable, except once we got into town some of the stores were intact. We saw Pearl Dragon still standing, a restaurant bar where we went every Wednesday, just to shoot the shit with fellow neighbors, see @terryleefradet at the bar, give a big bear hug to @megtremmm 

We passed the village, and got to Pali High which sustained massive damage but about 65%-70% is still ok and the hope is that they find an alternative campus…Everett is on zoom right now and I know this brings back painful memories of Covid. 

We pulled up to the house, and I didn’t really want to get out of the car, but forced myself to. We donned our PPE… tyvek suit, booties, goggles, respirator, gloves… and took our first steps onto our property since we were evacuated on 1/7/25.  There was nothing left, basically a lot of debris that didn’t have any meaning anymore.  This was not my house anymore. There was a certain amount of closure and clarity because seeing something so unrecognizable was a way for me to come to terms that we have to move on.  I know most of my friends want me to let it out, to cry, to scream, to show more emotion.  It will come…

I don’t want to publish all my photos I took of the house, seems too personal right now, but I did see my happy succulents till growing, bees and nature still moving forward… *Neighbors, please take some cuttings and grow some memories…    

Doug found a vintage fire truck we were saving to sell on EBay, which brought a little humor to the situation…

Until next time Palisades…#palistrong #wewillrebuild #palisadesfire #lafires #pacificpalisades #lawildfires",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFk6q3jPwvd/,2025-02-02 16:16:59+00:00

"Un anno fa, durante un viaggio on the road per il mio compleanno, siamo partiti da Los Angeles, facendo tappa a Malibu. Ricordo ancora il vento salmastro sul viso, la luce dorata che baciava gli scogli di El Matador Beach e quel mare che sembrava respirare insieme a noi. Poi abbiamo imboccato la Mulholland Drive, quella strada che serpeggia tra le colline, sospesa tra cielo e terra, con il mondo che si srotolava ai nostri piedi, vasto e silenzioso.

Oggi voglio tornare lì con il pensiero. Non per nostalgia, ma per rendere omaggio a ciò che è stato e a ciò che sta lottando per essere ancora. Gli incendi che hanno devastato queste terre hanno lasciato cicatrici profonde, visibili e invisibili. Mi chiedo quanto tempo ci vorrà perché la natura si rigeneri, per ritrovare il verde dove ora c’è cenere, per sentire di nuovo il canto degli uccelli là dove regna il silenzio.

Ma la natura conosce il segreto della guarigione. Sa rinascere dove tutto sembra perduto, sa trasformare la distruzione in un nuovo inizio. È un processo lento, silenzioso, spesso invisibile agli occhi impazienti. Eppure accade, sempre.

Oggi voglio immaginare Malibu come l’ho vista io, con il cielo che sfuma nell’oceano e i campi di fiori selvatici mossi dal vento. Voglio credere che tornerà così. E mentre la natura fa il suo corso, tocca a noi prendercene cura, con rispetto, con amore, ricordando che ogni albero, ogni animale, ogni respiro di vento ha un valore che va oltre ciò che possiamo misurare.

Perché la bellezza non è solo da guardare. È da proteggere.

"When I was feeling very distressed about the January fires in Los Angeles, I coped by creating a motif to express the place that LA has in my heart. The soothing blues in the motif evoke many things including the beautiful sky and water that are associated with the city.  I have lived in Los Angeles twice and experienced many personal milestones there.  So many friends have been affected by this catastrophe.  I decided to put my motif on some products to raise some money for the ReBUILD LA fund that is a part of Habitat for Humanity.  All net profits from sales of these items (which start at $5 for a sticker) will be donated. Link in profile under Merchandise. Thank you for any contributions you make to any of the organizations that are helping the fire victims.

Janeta ‘s  Olive Tree was saved!!!

"My mom is 89-years-old today.

On January 7th, she was evacuated from her apartment due to the horrific fires that destroyed so much of beautiful Pacific Palisades.

Mom was a speech pathologist for many years for the Los Angeles Unified School District, and  she worked with special needs students. Frankly, it pisses me off that life has thrown this crisis at her when she’s at the end of her life, but it is what it is.

If you had told me my stunning hometown would look like a bomb hit most of it, I wouldn’t have believed you. I moved from Pacific Palisades to Santa Cruz County when I was 17 to attend college.

Ironically, in 2020 our little town in the 
Santa Cruz Mountains was struck by the 
CZU Fires after the pandemic had begun.

We were evacuated for three weeks, and we struggled to find places to stay that would accept our precious Lucy, but thank God goodness our home survived, unlike many houses that burned to the ground.

When you’re feeling down…when you’re having a “meh” day, if you have a place to call your own, please take a moment to cherish it.

"It’s been almost 1 month, and it still doesn’t feel real. My heart aches for so many close friends—and friends of friends—who have also experienced such profound loss, and for our beautiful city of Los Angeles, which will never be the same.

To our wonderful family and friends who have reached out to Peter, Connie, and our family: thank you. Your love, kindness, and generosity—the drop-offs, the donations—mean more than words can express. We feel your support deeply, and it fills our hearts.

My amazing in-laws, Peter and Connie, lost everything in their Malibu home. Their entire stretch of the coast burned to the ground—utterly devastating and heartbreaking.

If you’ve ever been to their home, you know the love that greeted you at the door, the warmth that surrounded every moment. It wasn’t just a house; it was a haven. The place where my three girls took their first steps on the sand. The deck where we shared chicken and dumplings, spaghetti dinners, and endless laughter. The beach where we swam, explored magical tide pools, and watched the sunsets fade into night.

Their home was more than a physical space—it was a feeling, a sanctuary where joy and happiness thrived. It was our happy place, filled with unforgettable memories and love.

Thank you, Big Rock, for 23 years of magic. You’ll forever hold a special place in our hearts, and we will miss you always.

" Air Quality Monitoring in Fire-Affected Areas 

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) has begun air monitoring efforts in the burn scars and surrounding communities of the Eaton Fire and Palisades Fire. This initiative, in collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), aims to assess air quality during debris removal and cleanup.

 Why is this important?
Debris removal can cause hazardous dust and ash to become airborne, potentially affecting air quality and public health.

 Monitoring will occur in two key stages:

 Stage One: Mobile Air Monitoring (4 weeks)
 Two mobile units will measure toxic metals & volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
 Identify potential hot spots near the burn zones
 Help determine locations for temporary air monitoring stations

 Stage Two: Stationary Air Monitoring
 Air monitoring stations will track particulate matter (PM), lead, arsenic, and asbestos
 Placement will be based on mobile monitoring data, cleanup activity, and proximity to homes & schools
 Ongoing coordination with federal, state, and local agencies

⚠️ Important Reminder:
Residents should not attempt to clean up fire debris (burned structures, vehicles, furniture, etc.). The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LADPH) and Pasadena Public Health Department (PPHD) have prohibited unsafe removal of fire debris to protect public health.

"The Palisades is made up of a few sections: the Highlands (high on the hills where the fire started), Marquez (below the highlands), the el Medio bluffs, the Via bluffs, the village, the Alphabets and the Huntington (to name a few). This is the drive I take through one street in the Huntington, continued through the old village. It does not include the Via bluffs, the el Medio bluffs or the Alphabets. The Alphabets are a grid of streets much like New York City where every street is a letter of the alphabet (Albright, Bestor/Bashford, Carey, Chautauqua, embury, Fisk, galloway etc). The Alphabets were demolished (not pictured but seen all over the news). Row after row after row of houses is completely flattened. They are “above” the village. The Via Bluffs are mostly destroyed (not pictured- “below” the village), and the el Medio bluffs are half-destroyed (also not pictured). The Huntington had some streets totally in tact. My drive started with so much hope on one of those streets. But just down the road the fire took almost everything in its path. Also to note. On slide 6/9 you hear me say the village is standing. This is reference to the new village that a wonderful developer created for us a few years ago. It was protected and will be the saving grace of the Pali return. The part I am driving through is the old village, these shops and restaurants existed before the new village was created. These slides feature a direct line driving through 1/10th of the Palisades. Maybe less. I don’t even know why I am posting! Maybe just because there is so much curiosity around this fire and the news can’t quite capture it.  But for those whose hearts were captured by this tragic event, here is a window into our world. I have to say it is the best of the disaster. The destruction of the Alphabets is mind-blowing.

"The second casualty in any disaster is INFORMATION

Well - I feel like we have lived a year in the past two months. On top of the trauma and devastation experienced by many of us, one of complicating factors was/is the vast overload of misinformation. 
Having worked with the Malibu CERT at the Emergency Supply Distribution Center at the equestrian center, the Resident burn area reentry lines at Malibu Pier and the Burn Area Resident Pass line at  City Hall  I have been in the middle of the “information word salad” (a chopped salad I might add.) I have seen the tears, anger and the confusion on many of your faces. 

Being the PIO for the CERT and being somewhat well connected with Malibu online,  I have tried  to dispel some of the misinformation out there and give out helpful accurate information. Most of the time I have been on point and sometimes I have failed. One of the problems is the multiple sources of information. We recently have had LA County Sheriff’s, LAPD, LA County FD, LAFD, CAL Fire, National Guard, City of LA, City of Malibu, and now the EPA up in our business! All working from different priorities, giving different orders, and talking on different radios. They are at times not cooperating with each other, and at times not sharing vital information. This has happened nearly after every disaster, and during many military battles.

"Was able to go up to the house and into downtown Palisades for the first time since the fire. Unbelievable how destructive the Palisades Fire was, and how many structures have been lost or damaged. The first photo is from the house, and the second is of my favorite Cafe (Flour)...where I went every single morning for years to eat breakfast, have a coffee, journal, and read a book. In fact, I was there when the fire started. While it's beyond sad what has happened to the town and so many people who live here, I'm trying to stay positive and see this as an opportunity to rebuild the Palisades even stronger, better, and more resilient in the future! Like a phoenix! ️‍♀️ 

My heart goes out to everyone in the community.

"Palisades Studio is a cherished home for many young dancers from the Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and Topanga communities. Unfortunately, a devastating wildfire on January 7, 2025, destroyed many homes and displaced almost all of our studio families. In response, Palisades Studio is relocating to Abby Lee Dance Studio in West Los Angeles to provide a haven for dancers to continue their training.  

What we have been hearing from our families is that these kids need to dance. they need a sense of normalcy and healing—an opportunity to feel grounded once again.  

Your generous donation will ensure that Palisades Studio remains open during this uncertain time and guarantee that no dancer is turned away due to financial hardship. Together, we can keep this vital community alive and help these young dancers continue to thrive.  

We, Derek & Cami Capps, are the Directors of Palisades Studio and also live in the Pacific Palisades. Our family is currently displaced and looking for a new home, but we’re committed to serving our community with the art of dance.

"Bruce Willis is showing his gratitude to the first responders battling wildfires in Los Angeles. In a rare public appearance, the actor was seen shaking hands with LAPD officers and thanking them for their service. This heartfelt moment was shared by his wife, Emma Heming, on Instagram, bringing attention to the brave efforts of firefighters and law enforcement amidst the devastating fires. The wildfires have affected over 180,000 people, leaving thousands of homes destroyed, and Bruce’s display of appreciation resonates deeply with many.

"My next door neighbor just sent me this photo. On the left, her son was scootering over to our house to drop off some Christmas toys for Ziggy. It was so sweet. She took the same photo on the right less than a month later. 

It’s hard to believe it’s been almost a month since our beloved home , our town, our neighbors, our friends‍♂️ and so many of my clients, our dentist and vet, pharmacist, grocery, nail salon, massage place, all burned to the ground. In one night, our lives changed forever. We lived in a slice of heaven. Woke up to the birds chirping and the most beautiful pink sunrises you’ve ever seen. Daily walks around the bluffs⛰️, which took our breath away every single day with the majestic views of the ocean from our cliffs. I obsessed over our lush green landscaping, especially our bright pink Bougainvillea in front of our house.  We were often visited by 2 owls at night who loved to tease Ziggy! We even had a mountain lion come visit us at our canyon door (thank God while we were sleeping).
They say time heals all wounds. I don’t think I’m there yet. We are moving into a cute house in a few weeks in Westwood/ Holmby Hills area (change of plans from earlier) and we know and adore the owners so at least we have a place to go to where we will feel safe and comfortable- and there’s a backyard for Ziggy to run around! Baby steps. 
We feel so lucky that we have such an amazing support system. My sister and brother in law have taken us in to their beautiful home and made us feel so comfortable ❤️. Our friends and family, clients and colleagues have been so kind and generous in checking in with us and making sure we have everything we need. It’s all overwhelming. 
Andy and I have our permits and our hazmat suits ready to go see our Palisades home in person, but emotionally we aren’t ready to go. In due time…
Thank you to everyone from the bottom of our hearts for your continuing support❤️.

Two thoughts for how to support people who lost their home in a fire:
1. Don’t tell them it can be worse. Of course it can be worse. It’s also really bad. Almost every home in my community burned down. That’s awful. 
3. Don’t tell them things are replaceable. I get this comment everyday. Many things are but not everything is. No one has ever stopped mourning something they lost because a person reminded them things are replaceable.

"Dear Community of #Malibu & #Palisades,

Last week, we met with many homeowners in Malibu and Palisades who were finally able to return to their properties. These visits were filled with understandable sadness, anger, and hurt. Seeing the devastation firsthand, where decades of memories have been reduced to ash, is truly heartbreaking. During these difficult moments, I shared my own experience of losing my childhood home in a fire many years ago. Our family, like many of you, lost everything, including my father. However, with a strong support system, we were able to rebuild our home and our lives.

I know that the road ahead will be challenging, but I also know that the communities of Malibu, Palisades, and Altadena are resilient. We will rebuild, one step at a time.

At KASH Construction, we understand the emotional and practical challenges you're facing. We're here to support you through every step of the rebuilding process, from the initial inspections, cleanup, and hauling, to navigating the complexities of plans and permits, and ultimately, the construction of your new home.

We offer comprehensive assistance to help you get back on your feet:

Inspections and Assessments: We'll conduct thorough inspections to assess the damage and provide you with a clear understanding of the next steps.
Cleanup and Hauling: We'll manage the cleanup and debris removal process efficiently and respectfully.

Plans and Permits: We'll guide you through the process of obtaining the necessary permits and developing plans for your new home.

Reconstruction: We’ll work with you to rebuild your home, incorporating your vision and ensuring quality craftsmanship.
We understand that this isn't just about rebuilding a house; it's about rebuilding a home filled with cherished memories. We are committed to helping you restore not just your property, but also your sense of place and community.

We're here for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for a free initial consultation. We’re happy to answer your questions and discuss how we can help.

Sincerely,

Rob Kashefi- KASH Construction

"WE ARE LA STRONG! ❤️ www.artofinkca.com

Hi friends! As many of you know… my 91 year old grandmother lost her home in Altadena of over 60 years. 

Sadly, she was not the only one. Thousands of homes and business are completely gone because of the Eaton fire and the Palisades fire.

As heartbreaking as it has been… we’d like to provide some help, love, and joy to others that are still suffering.

We are LA STRONG.

We at @artofinkla are donating 100% of the proceeds to rebuilding efforts and to the @pasadenahumane 

That’s right… 100%… ALL OF IT.

So many of my friends have come together to support my family… I thank you endlessly… and we would like to help give back to the entire community.

We are not alone.

Together… we are LA STRONG. ❤️

This is a picture of my neighbor from across the street, JB Borris. He was the emergency block captain on Aloha where our house was. The second picture is what the park looks like now. Photo Phillip Cheung.

The two photos are from a GoFundMe page for the Tahitian Terrace organized by Barbara Corcoran of Shark Tank, a resident of the Mobil home park.

"Iconic Mexican Fan palms grace our So Cal landscape but act as match sticks if not properly pruned. Yes, palms can be recognized as sanctuaries for wildlife that live amongst the skirt’s fronds; however, one needs to think clearly when palm trunks become too enveloped with dead fronds. Now any spark of fire can send embers up and within the canopy. Fire then spreads rapidly as the dead fronds fall and sail about; the heavy fire starters landing haphazardly encouraged by the wind. The palms pictured have been mostly “cleaned” up to the top and may survive a fire because of the trunks’ innate vascular system and the protected terminal bud (new baby fronds). The palms’ aesthetic beauty and the environmental arguments for a natural untrimmed palm “look” withstanding, one must weigh the value and take steps accordingly.

"Devastated that this is the aftermath of my childhood home. My childhood home, school, park and entire neighborhood burned down in the Eaton Fire. It’s taken me a while to post about it because it’s truly heartbreaking to see so many cherished childhood memories turn to ash. The birthday parties with the incredible ice sculptures, the 30 girls from my class that would come over for sleepovers (yes all at the same time bless my parents lol), the neighbors that would pile onto the driveway to watch the cities 4th of July fireworks, the walks to school in the morning and hikes in the mountain in the evenings, the dance recitals at the park around the corner. Our house in the hills that held so many very dear memories in my heart. However it’s been incredible to see how the community has come together across Altadena, Pasadena and all of LA. I’m glad all family and friends are doing ok. The LA and Dena communities are strong and will rebuild. If you’re looking for organizations to donate to visit FireAidLA.org

"A month ago I had just dropped off Ford for his first day of school. I was at Costco when I got the news about the fire and everything has changed since then. I still can’t believe that this is happening. Not in a million years did I think I would be displaced from a wildfire and our whole town would burn down. The endless phone calls and zoom meetings, and WhatsApp groups. The lack of information and  coordination. We live in the 21st century and I feel like it’s a third world country. Sean and I used to joke about that because we never had cell phone reception in the Palisades. 
I’m still at a loss for words with what happened. Evacuating, pulling Ford out of class, no water in the hydrants, fireman not getting to the fire for over 45 minutes. Everything was bad. Seeing my town on fire, my friend’s house burning - I will never get the images out of my head. 
A part of me is angry. I feel like a lot was taken from me, from us. I miss worrying about everyday things that were so big to me, like what preschool Ford was going to go to. Now I miss the little things, like walking to the bluff every day and seeing all the dogs in the neighborhood. Which now to me, are the big things. I want to be back living our normal lives. All I can do is cry knowing it will not be normal again for a very long time. 
I miss January 6. I miss what was. 
People will go on who were not affected. They will go on and live their normal lives like before, and yet, for us Palisadians, nothing will be the same. We will never forget. 
I’m ranting, but this is HARD.

"If you’re navigating hard, read this…

No one teaches us how to heal. There’s no roadmap, no step-by-step process. It’s messy, nonlinear, and often hits when we least expect it.

But the truth? 

Healing isn’t about erasing the past - it’s about making space for it, accepting it, learning from it, and still choosing to move forward. 

Drop a ❤️ if this resonates with you. 

Reminder to Save it for when you need it.

"My grandparents, Jan and Frank Day, left an incredible mark on the beauty industry—helping hundreds of thousands of people become financially independent since the 1950s through selling @jafracosmetics @jafra_mx beauty products. They always told me they wanted to create something that could survive economic downturns, something that could bring people joy even in the hardest times. Having lived through the Great Depression, they understood that when the world feels like it’s crumbling, beauty still has the power to lift people up.

I never truly understood the depth of their wisdom—until now.

One of my dearest friends whisked me away to the @chrismcmillanthesalon , knowing that a fresh new do would completely change my energy. It might seem superficial—after all, my home, my belongings, my entire neighborhood just burned to the ground. But as I sat there, watching the ashes of my old life fade away with every brush of color, I realized something: beauty heals.

Fire doesn’t just take your things—it takes your sense of normalcy, your grounding, your world as you knew it. And sometimes, something as simple as a haircut, a lipstick, or a fresh start in the mirror can remind you that you’re still here. That even after total destruction, there’s still joy to be found, confidence to reclaim, a future to step into.

My grandparents were absolutely right. When the world is burning, beauty has the power to help you rise from the ashes.

"“Fire and Fog”. So after four weeks in a hotel in Marina Del Rey, we ventured back up to the house for a check in. The house is still standing.  While there, the fog started rolling in and made the eerie landscape even more creepy. The silence was deafening.

"The City of Angels, lonely as I am together we cry ❤️‍ it’s been exactly 4 weeks since we got evacuated when the Palisades Fire broke out, Jan 7. I still can’t fully wrap my head around what happened and while I’m obviously extremely grateful that our neighborhood was saved by real life superheroes, it’s been difficult to feel happy when others so close to us have lost everything.  one thing I’ve learned through this rollercoaster of emotions and hard ache though is that LA truly consists of the kindest people and communities. It’s not just dreamers, it’s doers, makers and organizers. It will take a long time to rebuild the historic neighborhoods we’ve lost both in the East and in the West but this city gives me hope that it can be done. ❣️
Thank you @losangelesfiredepartment @lacountyfd our incarcerated fire fighters and all the fire fighting personnel that came to help from other counties, states and even countries and put their own lives on the line to save ours. ‍‍️

"LAPP ANNOUNCES BRIDGE THE GAPS -- WILDFIRE RELIEF FOR L.A. ARTISTS
 DONATE NOW VIA THE LINK IN OUR BIO 

As part of our ongoing commitment to filling the gaps in creative infrastructure, Los Angeles Performance Practice is launching BRIDGE THE GAPS — Wildfire Relief for L.A. Artists, a fund for fire-impacted artists with a focus on performing artists.

Following the devastating fires that have torn through our beloved City of Angels, we’ve been listening to your needs. Our Artist Survey, “Are You Okay?” received close to 200 responses, and one thing is especially clear: Los Angeles artists need support, and performing artists in particular may slip through the cracks of other funding opportunities.

The impact of the fires goes beyond the unfathomable loss of home and property; Los Angeles artists have lost performance spaces, residency time, instruments, supplies, and countless days of work. LAPP has created a stop-gap measure to provide direct relief grants to support Los Angeles artists.

LAPP has been awarded a supplemental grant of $50,000 from one of our incredible funders to kick off BRIDGE THE GAPS. We are hoping to match these funds from you, our community.

To support BRIDGE THE GAPS, donate via the link in our bio. Every donation, small or large, allows LAPP to directly support artists in L.A. who may not be eligible for other relief funding that is based on loss of property. 

Please spread the word and share with colleagues, collaborators, donors, and friends. Your support is crucial in reviving our creative ecosystem!

"The California Animal Response Emergency Support (CARES) program @cdfa_cares under @cafoodandag, partners with local agencies to ensure animals—small pets, livestock, and large animals—are cared for during emergencies. CARES actively assisted in the response to the Los Angeles wildfires.

Этот дом площадью 280 кв м с четырьмя спальнями в районе Pasadena в Лос-Анджелесе вышел на продажу на днях за $2,48 млн. 

Продавцы рекламируют его как дом, способный противостоять пожарам: ""Защита жизни и имущества достигается за счет изменений внешнего дизайна и конструкции с использованием одобренных пожарным инспектором штата Калифорния строительных материалов и конструкций, чтобы противостоять проникновению пламени или горящих углей, распространяемых лесным пожаром. Современный стиль сочетает в себе внутренние и внешние жилые пространства, которые плавно перетекают друг в друга, и сад с местными устойчивыми к засухе растениями"" 

‼️За последние две недели также РЕЗКО вырос спрос среди жителей Лос-Анджелеса на частные гидранты, систему автополива с возможностью установки, в том числе, на крыше и по периметру дома, насосы, шланги и прочую подсобную утварь‼️

Жители города больше не рассчитывают на помощь со стороны.... Спасение утопающих - дело рук самих утопающих

"The wildfires have devastated our community, destroying over 12,000 structures and causing nearly $1 billion in real estate losses. Families, homeowners, and entire neighborhoods have been displaced, leaving many scrambling to find a place to call home. 

As people search for temporary housing, Los Angeles’ high-end rental market is overwhelmed with demand. Even those with second properties are struggling to secure a home. 

Examples:
- A $13,000 per month rental in Santa Monica received a $20,000 upfront offer, only for the landlord to counter with $23,000. 
- A $30,000 per month Century City apartment had 28 competing applicants in a single day. 
- One agent reported waking up to over 100 texts daily from desperate clients looking for shelter. 
- Rental options, though scarce, now range from $3,000 to $250,000 per month, stretching from Santa Barbara to San Diego. 

Despite California’s emergency price cap limiting rent increases to 10%, some landlords are raising prices as displaced residents offer higher upfront payments in hopes of securing housing. 

My heart lies with everyone affected as they navigate the road to recovery.  Please connect with me if you need any assistance

"The star-studded FireAid concerts raised $100 million for wildfire relief efforts last week while the Grammy Awards weekend brought in $24 million for similar efforts, organizers announced Tuesday.⁠
⁠
FireAid, which featured more than 30 acts including Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Nicks, and a surprise Nirvana reunion, took place at the Kia Forum and Intuit Dome in Inglewood on Thursday.⁠
⁠
In addition to fans inside the arenas, FireAid was seen by about 50 million viewers on 28 different streaming platforms, all of which offered viewers a chance to donate as they watched.⁠
⁠
The $100 million estimate announced Tuesday included sales of tickets and merchandise, sponsorships, large donations by artists such as the Eagles and U2 who did not perform, and contributions from the Irving Azoff family, Andrew Hauptman and Ellen Bronfman Hauptman, and more.⁠
⁠
The Los Angeles Clippers, whose home is Intuit Dome, covered operating costs. Steve and Connie Balmer, who own the Clippers and their arena, matched every pledge made during the broadcast of FireAid.⁠

" GUARDIANS: Stories of Courage & Resilience 

‍ Engineer Jeremy Dann – LAFD Station 35

Ever since he was young, Jeremy dreamed of becoming a firefighter. After attending Butte Fire Academy, he served the city of Ventura in an ambulance before joining the LAFD academy.

 Just as the intense Santa Ana winds began, Jeremy returned to work the day the Palisades Fire ignited. He remained on the frontlines, protecting homes, helping evacuate residents, and serving the city of LA.

 On day eight of his deployment, his wife and three kids surprised him at base camp. Despite little sleep, smoke inhalation, and sheer exhaustion, Jeremy still had a smile on his face and was ready to serve. His station isn't just a workplace—it's a second family.

 Jeremy represents LA firefighters' strength, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication, showing up for his city even in the most grueling conditions.

 Right now, Jeremy is deployed all week in case of mudslides. THANK YOU for your continued service! ❤️❤️

 Nominate a firefighter to be featured in this project! Drop their name in the comments or DM me their story. Let's make sure their sacrifices are never forgotten.

 Special thanks to @rocampaxmama, Lauren Dann, Jeremy's wife, for sharing his story.

 Proceeds from this book will directly support a firefighter relief fund—the specific fund will be chosen with input from firefighters to ensure the greatest impact.

"          | In a remarkable display of compassion and teamwork, the San Bernardino Animal Services Department has dedicated the past three weeks to aiding their Los Angeles counterparts in the wake of the devastating Palisades Fire. 

Responding to a formal request for assistance on January 15, they joined forces with teams from Riverside County and Mission Viejo, sending animal control officers to the affected areas to rescue pets and wildlife that were lost, abandoned, or injured. 

Director Kris Watson emphasized the importance of this collaboration, “Helping other jurisdictions in need following a disaster is not only the right thing to do, but our staff gain crucial skills that can help San Bernardino’s residents if something were to happen here.""

City of San Bernardino Animal Services Supervisor, Arianna Gonzalez, Lead Animal Control Officer, Eduardo Alvarez as well as Animal Control Officers Patrick Galvan, Jasmine Torres and Estevan Barajas worked in shifts traveling to Los Angeles to assist in the effort.

The emotional rewards of their efforts were highlighted by the heartfelt gratitude expressed by local residents, including notable figures like comedian Jay Leno. 

Each day began with a list of addresses, as the team sought to provide updates and locate pets left behind. In a touching moment, they reassured a homeowner that her 28 koi fish had survived the fire, successfully evacuating them to safety at DreamWorks Studios.

The City of San Bernardino will receive reimbursement for their dedicated service from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

"These are my friends Isabella and Caroline and they are basically like my little sisters. The three of us attended the concert last week and while it was beautiful it was also very very hard. I’m so so grateful to have had my home survive by some miracle but this period of time has been extremely hard for me as well. This is the town we grew up in, Our preschool, our library, our yogurt shop, their church, etc etc etc. I had to step away multiple times when they showed the videos of the destruction and fire because of how hard I was crying. But thank you to fire aid because it was such an incredible event. THANK YOU to that incredible worker who hugged me when I stepped away to sob. Thank you to Gracie for making me smile and scream (screech) my heart out, thank you to Olivia for making Caroline smile from ear to ear, thank you to Earth Wind and Fire for making Isabella giggle and sing as loud as she wanted. But most of all thank you to Katy Perry. To us she truly had the best set of the night. It was empowering and motivating and beautiful. She is truly an artist that we all grew up listening too throughout our childhoods and she was just so incredible and moving tonight. We screamed our hearts out together to ‘Roar’ and ‘California Girls’ and afterwards izzy turned to me and she said “that was amazing and you know what I think we are going to be okay.” Finally a special shoutout to our favorite guest in attendance tonight, it was an honor to be in the same stadium as you. @kamalaharris  Thank you all ❤️‍

"I've got a big dream, its to help the folks rebuild from this disaster.... Its a place where the voices of the people, work for the people. Where Confusion is abolished and stomped to the ground. I'm tired of hearing how help takes forever and its a run around chase for those who need it most. What would it take, to get There inputs and collaborate, to gather effective resources in regards to rebuilding their lives? A 1 stop shop for help, instead of hours of searching. What if a web page could be created to collect the following : Date resource was applied for, Date it was received. Who provided it, what was physically provided such as financial aid, housing leads, food availability, temp shelter opportunities, etc. Then the victims voices would be heard as they reported who was effective and who wasn't, because the more feedback each received, the greater of a score it would receive. then that info would be shared freely for all to see. Id like to see it in an App form, such as Watch Duty, and integrate it on a local map. ITs a lot to ask for but once established it could report real time and increase efficiency and most importantly allow the families, an easier way to move forward. Yes its just a dream but my hope is that I'll be able to point folks to the available resources, because like them I'm not in the know and it will take hours to figure the system out. this could be used in any disaster if the product produced was quality. till then....#lafires #altadena #palisadesfire",812348069,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFrjZfYRFig/,2025-02-05 06:08:19+00:00
"Had to head to Malibu today to check on a few of our listings and chose to take PCH instead of going up and around through Kanan which we’ve had to do since they shut down the road. This was my first time making this drive since the fires tore through last month.

The devastation along the coast is absolutely staggering. Seeing the aftermath firsthand was heartbreaking—charred landscapes, homes reduced to rubble, and a silence that felt as heavy as the grief in the air. At one point, I almost turned around because it was just too much to take in.

My heart goes out to everyone who has been displaced, to those who lost their homes, their memories, and so much more. LA is hurting, and today’s drive was just a small glimpse of that pain.

But through the ashes, there is hope. This city, these communities, and the people who call them home are resilient. We’ve seen it before, and we’ll see it again—rebuilding, coming together, and rising stronger than ever. The road to recovery won’t be easy, but light always finds a way through the darkness. Malibu, Palisades and Altadena will heal, and so will we.

Say hello to my first much much needed-⬇️
 CALIFORNIA STRONG rainbow 
If there’s one thing that I’ve learned this past month navigating one of the worst storms of my life …it was the possibility of a rainbow up ahead…
Designing a rainbow necklace is one of my favorite things to do…
It’s very personal for me and it takes a specific mindset when I create one…my energy has to be right…and yesterday was finally the day that these beautiful stones called out to me…
Again, all the gemstones have been donated so graciously for this rainbow…My #calistrong rainbow will be limited as I want her to be special and would also like her to symbolize the hope right now that each fire victim is looking for….
This 14k #calistrong rainbow has been claimed by a lovely client…But I will make a few more with the donated gemstones that have the most loving juju in them…
You can select the silk color,
Length, and findings to suit your needs… gold fill or sterling silver pricing will start at $450 and go up for 14k…dm to get started…
California pendants sold Seperate …

And remember to always always look for a rainbow after the storm…

"Lung health matters. Poor air quality, allergies, and respiratory issues can make life tough for your pet. These natural supports can help open airways and keep them breathing strong:

 Medicinal Mushrooms – Reishi & Cordyceps boost oxygen flow and immune defenses.
 Herbal Lung Support – Pet Well Being Lung Gold, Respir-Gold & Throat Gold soothe irritation. Mullein leaf tincture is also another good option (check out @canineherbalist for a recent post about sourcing and dosing).
️ NAC (N-Acetylcysteine) – A powerhouse antioxidant for lung protection.
️ Essential Oil Diffusion – Vet-formulated blends to support clear breathing.
✨ Quercetin – Nature’s antihistamine to calm allergies and inflammation.

If your pet has chronic respiratory issues or is exposed to poor air quality, consider combining a few of these supports for maximum benefit. Always introduce new supplements gradually and consult your vet before starting. Breathing easy starts with you!

"It’s so hard to fathom, I can’t go home. I’ll never sit in my kitchen and watch the cars go by on Sunset. I’ll never dance around my living room because my favorite song is playing. I’ll never admire my massive book collection again. My complete physical history is gone making my memories even more vivid. I suppose it’s like losing one sense and another becoming heightened. My daughter asked why I keep going back to look through the wreckage of our former home and it’s because I’m searching for something that was mine. Something to prove that I was really there. I feel like a ghost, there but not there. Wearing my clothes that aren’t my clothes, doing the things that I’m supposed to be doing although I don’t know why. I’m sure one day it might make sense but for now it’s a battle of fight, flight and freeze. Of feeling unsafe in the world. I do have moments of hope, when the kindness from others hits me and I’m filled with that warmth. When I feel resilient and see this as our origin story but those thoughts are fleeting. K and I will go on. She will graduate college and I will be her biggest cheerleader, I will make a new place our home, we will gather new memories and dance again. But this pain to go home will never go away.

"Construction in Los Angeles is already a nightmare. Permits drag, agencies are unorganized, and homeowners wait months—sometimes years—for basic approvals. @ladwp1 takes over a year to connect power after a home is fully built.  @lacopublicworks and the @socalgas are just as backlogged. And that’s under NORMALcircumstances.

Now, add 12,000+ structures that need to be rebuilt after these devastating fires. How can these same agencies, already struggling to keep up, possibly manage permits and services for an entire community’s reconstruction? Without a clear, streamlined plan, this will spiral into a logistical disaster, forcing families to wait a decade or more for their homes.

@mayorofla @gavinnewsom—this is where leadership is needed. This is a subject that is not talked about or looked at .  Without immediate action, what should take five years will stretch into over  a decade. The families who lost everything deserve better.

"Hope After Wildfires  Lahaina’s iconic Banyan Tree, standing tall for 150 years, is sprouting new growth—a symbol of resilience, renewal, and the strength of community. 18 months after the town’s devastating wildfire, this tree continues to recover, reminding us that even in destruction, life finds a way forward.

Just like this tree, rebuilding after wildfires requires patience, strength, and thoughtful design. A fire-resilient future means homes and communities that can withstand extreme conditions while honoring the past. Sustainability isn’t just about materials and energy—it’s about creating spaces that endure. 

I was born in Lahaina, and my family has lived there for generations. The impact of the devastation strengthened my commitment to designing and building wildfire-resilient homes. Rebuilding isn’t just about recovery—it’s about creating communities that can withstand future challenges while honoring their history. My work continues to focus on resilience, sustainability, and ensuring that what we build today can endure for generations to come.

"Wyatt is very proud of himself for getting his stitches out today!  

We amputated his leg due to suspected osteosarcoma with a pathologic fracture, which was unfortunately confirmed on histopathology. Amputation rarely cures osteosarcoma because of the aggressive nature and high rate of metastasis. For now, he doesn’t know he is sick and will be looking for a new family to live out the rest of his time in the comfort of a home with plenty of toys! Good boy, Wyatt!

"And after the fires came the rain. Gods tears washing away the ash and dust. Fortifying the soil, soaking the skeletons of trees and the ghosts of the now empty neighbourhoods. We have lived so much in these last few weeks. A collective trauma to be deconstructed and processed for the months and years to come. Everything feels different now. Forever characterized as “before” and “after” the fires. This heartbreaking cycle of loss and devastation but also the beauty and strength of community. Taking each day as it comes. Power has been restored in Malibu and school is back in session (for now). Having this normalcy feels important - especially for families who have lost everything. The air is not safe but we’ve been staying indoors with purifiers on as much as possible.

We’re still integrating all the emotions and hashing out our next steps. Grasping on to little moments of joy and beauty. Feeling beyond blessed for the bubble of protection that once again enveloped our beloved home and coastal canyon, for all the friends and acquaintances who reached out to check in on us, who sent prayers and love to Malibu.
Most importantly - gratitude and awe to the first responders and volunteer brigades (including many of our own volunteer fire fighting neighbours) who tried to do the impossible. I still have chills as I drive past trucks from across the country and see the staging operations set up along our beaches. Landslides and road closures will be inevitable. I haven’t yet driven through eastern Malibu or the portion of the pch and multiple neighbourhoods ravaged by the fire - Adam saw it earlier this week and wasn’t prepared for the magnitude of loss. It was closed again yesterday due to safety concerns, but I don’t feel ready to see it in person (I know this is a privilege!!!!)

Trying to welcome the optimism of a new month, volunteering and being of service, returning to some beloved routines and thinking about what the future might hold. Acutely aware of how fragile and uncertain everything about this life is!! All the while watching LA rise like the Phoenix ‍ that she is! #malibustrong #palisadesfire",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFtRlKQyeoO/,2025-02-05 22:11:07+00:00

"The EPA released this statement yesterday: 

The parking lot at Will Rogers State Beach will serve as a temporary site for household hazardous materials collected and transported from nearby properties to be consolidated, securely packaged, and safely loaded for transportation to a permanent disposal or recycling facility outside of the area. This location is suitable because it is flat, open land close to damaged properties that require debris removal.

The Will Rogers State Beach parking lot is a California State Parks property that has been operated by Los Angeles County for more than 50 years through an agreement with State Parks. Los Angeles County has a separate agreement with the City of Los Angeles for the maintenance of the parking lot. All agencies are working closely to complete this critical recovery work safely and efficiently.

The temporary processing site is closed to the public, and EPA is using best management practices to process any hazardous household material and keep it contained within the facility. Throughout this process, EPA will conduct air monitoring to ensure that operations in and around the site are health protective",214328843,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFtfCbMydwa/,2025-02-06 00:08:42+00:00

"Project Highlight : The Disaster After the Disaster

Join Christiahn (@christiahn) on a mission to inform and protect our community against the toxic waste created and dispersed by the fires. 

Not everyone is aware of the invisible danger created in the wake of the fires. The burning of asbestos-filled drywall, PVC pipes, and lead paint along with various chemicals and plastics has created toxic waste that poses long-term extreme health hazards. Generous volunteers helping to remove debris are being exposed without the appropriate personal protection equipment. Even those adjacent to fire-affected areas are exposed to this waste from toxic particulate carried by the winds. 

How can we insure that all of LA’s communities, including those most vulnerable, are informed and protected? This collaborative effort aims to do just that. 

This project is currently seeking help in these areas:
- Artists
- Copy Writers 
- Subject Matter Experts
- Designers 
- Native Speakers / Translators

"Federal and local agencies tasked with fire cleanup said on Wednesday that they are expecting to haul away over four million tons of contaminated debris — with much of it slated to end up in an increasing number of local landfills, as well as out of state.

Some of the most hazardous items from phase one of the cleanup are likely to end up in Arizona and Nevada, according to Michael Montgomery with the EPA, who is overseeing the cleanup effort.

Last week, Mark Pestrella, the director of county public works, announced that four local landfills would take in some fire debris, though exactly what is still unclear. But on Wednesday, he upped that number to 17 landfills across LA County and Ventura County, including in Simi Valley and Azusa, where material from five schools in Pasadena will go. An LA County Public Works spokesperson did not provide LA Public Press with a requested list of the landfills slated for use.

Montomery also did not answer LA Public Press’s question about where exactly the toxic waste from phase one of the cleanup will permanently end up. An EPA spokesperson also declined to provide LA Public Press with a list of the facilities.

"The Palisades fire may be contained but that doesn't mean the trails are ready for you, at least not yet!

Our very own Ranger James Latham was interviewed on why the burn area trails remain closed and how you can help expedite the reopening by exploring alternate locations.

Westridge Canyonback, San Vicente Mountain Park, Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park, and dirt Mulholland as well as trails around these parks remain closed for public use as trucks are accessing the paths repairing power lines and other important equipment along the canyons.

Burned out trees and falling rock also present environmental hazards and we expect mudslides during the storm.  

Please allow us, other agencies, and mother nature the time to heal and make the necessary repairs so we can welcome you back sooner!

The toils of yesterday fade once more
Like the crests of the waves
Leave the anchor of its shore

My path I carve
With hands of skill
Determined focused

Until the day
My heart is still

I rise from the ashes

The challenge of darkness
May eclipse
My thoughts
Stealing positive words
From my lips
Paralysing me to my fingertips

But again I will arise once more

Like I’ve done so many times before

As the crests of the wave
Leaves its anchor of the shore

" If you or someone you know is experiencing survivor’s guilt or other strong emotions after a #disaster, it’s essential to recognize that these feelings are a natural response to an extraordinary event.

Here are some steps that may help:

1️⃣ Acknowledge Your Feelings.
Allow yourself to feel the emotions without judgment. Writing in a journal or sharing with a trusted friend or counselor can be helpful. Embrace and notice your tears.

2️⃣ Seek Professional Support.
Therapists trained in trauma and resilience can help survivors process their experiences.

3️⃣ Engage in Community Support.
Being part of a supportive community fosters connection and collective healing. As the rebuilding process begins, it can also give meaning and purpose to one’s life.

4️⃣ Practice Self-Care.
Activities that promote physical and emotional health, such as regular exercise, mindfulness practices, or spending time in nature, can help regulate stress and enhance resilience. A simple walk with a friend can renew one’s energy.

5️⃣ Focus on the Present.
While it’s natural to reflect on the past, grounding techniques—such as noticing sights, sounds, and sensations around you—can anchor you to the present moment and reduce distressing thoughts.

Mindfulness practices like the Community Resiliency Model (CRM) provide practical tools for managing distress and reconnecting with a sense of well-being.

6️⃣ Participate in Faith Communities.
Many faith communities continue their ministries even though their church, synagogue, or temple may have been destroyed.

7️⃣ Engage in and Notice Acts of Generosity.
This engagement activates brain circuits that support well-being, whether witnessed, received, or given. 

Human beings can cultivate skills that directly influence the strength of the generosity circuit, so try to participate in acts of generosity.

" GUARDIANS: Stories of Courage & Resilience 

‍ Captain Robert (Rob) Landers – Downey Fire Department
After 19 years of service, Captain Rob Landers has faced countless fires, but nothing could prepare him for the Palisades Fire.

 On Sunday, January 5, Rob picked up an overtime shift at the station. Monday and Tuesday were his scheduled shifts, but by Tuesday afternoon, he texted his wife: ""There's a fire. They may be assembling strike teams.""

 By 6 PM, he was en route to the Palisades Fire, stepping into what would become the most intense blaze he had ever battled. Nearly every home they attempted to protect was already engulfed in flames. The hydrants were dry. The wind was relentless. Embers rained down, igniting anything in their path.

⚡ The wind was so fierce that an ember got inside their fire engine and caught fire. They managed to put it out, but not before it burned through the truck's electrical lines. Despite the chaos, by 3 AM, they were able to drive the engine back to base camp—just one challenge in the first 12 hours of this relentless fight.
 Captain Rob Landers represents the courage, sacrifice, and unwavering resolve of our firefighters, putting everything on the line to protect our communities.

 Nominate a firefighter to be featured in this project! Drop their name in the comments or DM me their story. Let's make sure their sacrifices are never forgotten.

 A huge thank you to @christyrl , Captain Landers' wife, for nominating him and sharing his incredible story. Your support and love for our firefighters make this project possible. ❤️

 Proceeds from this book will directly support a firefighter relief fund—chosen with input from firefighters to ensure the greatest impact.

"@chefjoseandres and @wckitchen are ultimate heroes in my eyes. For the many of us who have been displaced with the fires in Southern California, for me, particularly with the Eaton fire, world Central kitchen has ensured that they are widely available for members of the community who were affected by the fires to access good hot meals for themselves and their families. It has been completely eye-opening to me to witness their presence all around the community. If you have the means, I strongly encourage you to donate or volunteer to this amazing organization. As soon as I get my wits about me and get a little bit more steadier on my feet, this is the first organization I plan to put my money and energy toward. They 100% support the community with no judgment, and with all the warmth and love people experiencing tragedy need in the moment and throughout the horrific process of trying to figure out next steps.

I have witnessed through social media, their work across the country in the world. But I have never seen something so amazing firsthand.

He was accompanied by engineers from @caltrans  These were my first encounters with state agencies. They did not have enough material and were moving fast but doing their best. Thank you state county and local agencies #palisadesfire #wattles #storms,219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFvKQQ_JXU5/,2025-02-06 15:45:34+00:00
"Losing mommies art haunts me…
I am struggling with this ladies…
It’s a double doozy kind of loss…
Each painting she made me was done with so much love …And the thing about mommy was she would sit allll day and night to complete a painting for me…she did each one with all her heart and soul…
Litttle love notes were written on the back or sometimes a beautiful card…I can’t process this loss…each painting is connected with watching her paint it for me …
Giving it to me …
And then helping me hang it in my home…having her art work hanging on the walls of my home helped me with the grief of losing her…today is one of those very very sad days for me…

"January 2025 has been the longest month of my life , and this is picture number 3001 of me laying down with Dakota trying to figuring out life and what to do next …

Tomorrow we will finally go back to California after having lost our home to the Palisades fire , which means that we will drive up to our old home () and be there for the first time and say goodbye to get some closure…

My body is already rebelling to the thought that I will not longer live up in Skyhawk and I had the worst nightmares.

Can’t stop thinking about all the precious wildlife that Topanga has lost . 
We will not be able to take Dakota up there because it is too toxic for her , but at least she will be reunited with Fasa 

So grateful to be able to go back to Topanga for a while thanks to the best neighbors ever .

For the past three weeks, staff members from the SB Animal Services Department have been assisting their counterparts in Los Angeles. The officers would start the day with a list of addresses and pet owners hoping to either find or receive an update on pets they had to leave behind.

In one case, the San Bernardino team was able to let a relieved homeowner know that the 28 fish in one of her koi ponds had survived the fire. Although her house was destroyed, staff were able to locate and evacuate the fish from the disaster area, and they are now recovering in a pond at DreamWorks Studios.

"Last Tuesday marked 4 weeks since the horrific wildfire that broke out in Pacific Palisades leaving thousands of people “homeless”. :( Palisades is divided by a few neighborhoods, mine being Rustic Canyon… and Saturday with my resident “tag”, Tim and I drove around our town. I thought I was prepared to see the destruction that we’ve been watching over social media and news, but men, I wasn’t! Seeing with your own eyes, felt different. The images were surreal! The houses on the Bluffs are gone, the Alphabet streets are gone, Marquez Knolls are gone! Bienvenida, Highlands, Sunset and Huntington are a mix of houses standing and houses down. Sometimes you see a whole block burned to the ground with the exception of one house. Most of the businesses, churches and school are destroyed. My beautiful Palisades looks like a war zone, and I’m feeling terribly sad for my community! The frustration is also real, between all the mistakes made by @mayorofla and @gavinnewsom and all the insurance cancelations… but at the same time I am very thankful for the incredible job made by our firefighters, first responders, police officers and national guard. And my wishes for now is that the road to recovery is not (that) long! Palisades will rebuild, and we will get out of this stronger! #PalisadesStrong #PalisadesFire",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFvzLyYSwDz/,2025-02-06 21:43:13+00:00

"Update on Burned Vehicle Towing & Resident Concerns 

We understand the concerns about notices residents have received regarding vehicle towing. Here’s what you need to know:

 Why were vehicles towed?
✔️ CHP was directed by Fire Command to clear burned-out vehicles from public roads to restore utilities & ensure access for emergency crews.
✔️ Tows followed California Vehicle Code 22669(d) & were conducted with CHP-authorized rotation tow companies (which have fixed rates).
✔️ CHP does NOT receive fees for these tows.

Need help?
 Concerns about towing fees? Contact CHP to report service issues.
 Insurance claims? If you received a tow invoice, reach out to your insurance provider for guidance.
 CHP assisted in identifying VINs so insurance companies can properly compensate vehicle owners.

We know this is a challenging time, and we’re here to help. Please share this info with affected residents.

In moments like these, when everything feels overwhelming, sometimes a small comfort can make a world of difference. 

This church has been a place of love, faith, and community for so many—including @jennifer.garner who has shared her deep connection to it. We were honored to send these bears as a symbol of hope, reminding those affected that they are not alone and providing a sense of normalcy for kids.

"This photo represents a new beginning—a new environment, a new chapter—after losing my home in Malibu to the fires. It’s surreal how quickly life can change, how one moment you’re surrounded by everything familiar, and the next, you’re standing in the unknown, forced to rebuild from the ground up.

And yet, as I step into this new reality, I can’t help but hear a familiar soundtrack in my mind. This theme song couldn’t be more fitting for my life right now. It’s from the Rocky movies, which I’ve always loved—not just because of my passion for boxing, but because they embody what it means to never give up, no matter how hard life knocks you down.

One of my favorite lines from Rocky has always been:

“It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving.”

Life has tested me in ways I never imagined. Losing the love of my life. The heartbreak. The grief. The feeling of standing alone in the ring, taking hit after hit, without my greatest defender by my side. But what’s ironic is that the greatest fighter I’ve ever known—was him.

When you lose someone you love, you begin to realize just how much they live on inside you. Their lessons, their strength, their fire—it becomes part of you.

The day before he left this world, I told him how much I admired and wished I could have his unwavering strength. I had always stood behind him, letting him fight our life’s  battles. And in the way only he could, he looked at me and said:

“You are exactly like me. You just need to believe it.”

I only truly understood what he meant after he was gone—when I was left to face life’s challenges alone. Without my Rocky. Without my protector. 

And yet, here I am. Standing in the ashes. Navigating through the wreckage. Rising once again. Because that’s what fighters do.

The truth is, every challenge—every heartbreak, every loss, every moment that pushes you to the edge—isn’t just pain. It’s an opportunity. An initiation. A test to see if you will break or if you will rise.

It’s all about perspective. You can see hardship as the end, or you can see it as the beginning of something greater.

Today… let’s choose to rise!

"Spent last week in Los Angeles, filming stories about the aftermath of the fires. We met some lovely, inspiring people who are doing their best to get back to normal, and preserve what they loved most about their home. More from them soon on @newshour 

Here’s some of what I saw in Altadena, CA. I’ve covered so many different extreme disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires) and each has a different fingerprint in the way it rips up and distorts the order we try to put on the world. Captions below. 

1. A group from the California Conservation Corps carry a large filter (it's basically a mesh sock filled with mulch). They ring these around burned homes and cars after a fire to try and prevent any additional toxic runoff from the sites ending up in the local water system.

2. The interior of a burned out car with the windshield glass melted down onto the steering wheel.

3. Inside a shipping container on a building site.

4. A rivulet of melted steel. These are all over the place. 

5. Besides various metal objects (washing machines, bedsprings, etc), dishes and pottery are often the only recognizeable household items left after a house burns. 

6. Ruined out home in Altadena

7. ""NOT EV"" is spray-painted on all the non-electric cars, to signal to clean-up crews that they don't need to remove a gigantic lititum-ion battery from the wreckage.

And I was right. I choose sorting clothes and labeling. My memory of what to do on the sales floor kicked into gear and I started organizing the sizes. The clothes were already hung on my rack. After sorting the sizes it was onto labeling the clothing sizes. What wasn’t known with labels on sizing on particular clothing (and I looked everywhere… back of the neck, and it’s two sides of the garment) I placed off to the side to notify my costumes supervisors later and got it done. 

I got to meet people from the @directorsguild (last photo), and @ialocal871 (second photo with my supervisors to our volunteering.) 

Thank you so much, #local892 for setting up the volunteering schedule. I hope to volunteer again March 3rd with my husbands niece when she visits from the University of Hawaii.

If you are a local member and are available, please volunteer to help with our local fire victims. It will benefit you and our members. @iatselocal695 @695ywc

"Story of the day…

Rebirth

How many of us are looking around at this time finding ourselves in something that looks unfamiliar?

No certainty of what the future holds.

But, if we were to slowly become aware of this womb we find ourselves in.

And start to feel that we are not alone in this void.

We would feel that there are others who are looking for a foothold, too.

Some sense of familiar they can hang their hat on.

But, this new reality can’t quite be seen, yet.

It is still taking a moment to take shape.

We are slowly realizing that we are the sculptors of this new reality.

And step by step, we are remembering that we do hold that power of shaping our future.

As we feel that it is love that is our amniotic fluid, we find ourselves birthed anew.

For we are no longer choosing fear to see what options lie ahead for us.

We are now choosing love.

And as we hold our neighbors’ hands, we will rise into a new reality of our making.

"It has been about a month since the LA wildfires began in January. With now full containment the city tries to move forward. Yet, moving forward looks different for everyone. Some mourn the loss of their homes, others grieve loved ones. From massage therapists to labor workers, from the unhoused now further displaced—many have been touched by the devastation. The city feels fractured, its wounds still fresh. Yet, the spirit of community, the pillar of Angelenos, holds strong. 

Meeting each person where they are physically, mentally, and emotionally, these are some portraits of Angelenos I have shared space with these past few weeks. I love you LA.

"I came to be here. I know I will stand in the centre of the fire with my family and not stand down.
 I have touched the centre of my own sorrow, and  been opened by life’s betrayals. 
 I have become shriveled from fear and pain.
I sit with my pain, yours, my family and friends, without moving to hide it, or fade it, or fix it. I live with this pain, yours and mine, and still stand at the edge of the Palisades Bluffs and look to the ocean and into the horizon… 
Only to dive deeper inside my soul and tell myself 
I can get up after all this despair, weary and bruised to the bone and do what needs to be done for my family and for our community. 
 I  know my soul and what sustains it comes from the inside. I stand with the sorrow as it is vital to my rebirth. To our rebirth. I know my strength comes from within and my love for my family so immense that this unphatonable ravishing of my heart and tear in my soul will only give me wings to rise above the ashes. 
Yes, life goes on and we will all move on. Yet the pain is so intense and it is a part of who I am now. A part of all of us.  I want to embrace it, honor it understand it, and grow with it. Forever inside my soul.

"Took a minute to get these out of the camera. Call it lack of desire to be reminded. This is Palisades fire from my perspective and where I was able to be and needed to be. With just 35 and 50mm lenses and no press pass (rectified that) I captured what I saw when I wasn't busy spraying my house with water, patrolling neighborhood for looters, asleep in my car, going home to home looking for generator oil, backing into garage, conversing with fire women and men and sneaking in (around the road closures) some rides. Thanks to all fire departments from multiple cities, counties and states for saving (for the most part) our neighborhood.

"The Journey of the Cuddle Puddle-

We embarked on a transformative journey, breathing new life into a once-closed and underutilized space, lovingly known as the “cuddle puddle.” This inviting sunken sofa became a sanctuary where individuals of all ages, from one to one hundred, could find joy, relaxation, and moments of reflection. It was my heartfelt intention to cultivate a space where cherished memories would flourish for years to come.

As we opened the steel and glass doors to embrace nature, we invited our inner children to emerge and play. Gazing up at the exquisite constellation chandelier, we were reminded of a time when the stars felt both small and infinitely vast. 

In every corner of our beautiful cuddle puddle, creativity, passion, and unwavering dedication came together to manifest the belief that the sky’s the limit. With deep gratitude, we celebrate the moments we shared, forever etched in our hearts.

I admired  this building from the day I moved to the 90272 in 2007 for its grandeur and warmth. It was built in 1924, once painted pink and housed Petit Ami (a children’s boutique) and most recently renovated into a @starbucks.palisades.

"A few weeks ago, at the invitation of Assemblymember José Solache @asmsolache ,  I, along with Vice Mayor @cmkarinamacias, witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by the Palisades Fire. We received a briefing from @calfire , learning about the challenges faced and the heroic efforts of first responders. 

In moments of crisis, our community steps up. From firefighters and first responders—both local and out-of-state—to countless volunteers - we saw incredible acts of care and compassion. But we know the road to recovery is long.

As President of the CA League of Cities Women's Caucus @calcities, I want to emphasize that women often bear the greatest burdens in times like these, yet face the hardest path to recovery. We must ensure equitable access to resources—housing, healthcare, childcare, and financial aid—so all families can rebuild.

Our resilience is stronger than the devastation, and together, we will rise. Sending love to Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and beyond.

I think I accidentally said that yesterday was the one-month anniversary of us having to evacuate from the #PalisadesFire, but that day is actually today, and the days have been rushing together. If the time isn’t flying by, it’s refusing to move forward, but this morning is a day I’ve been waiting for, for what seems like forever, and I’m excited to make the most out of it.

 At the most inconvenient time, I bought this #MonsteraPlant without any convenient place to put it. It’s traveled to four places with me now, with its current spot being in my new shower because I still have to keep it away from Izzy  I’ll eventually hang it in the shower. I absolutely needed to have something that made the statement, “I will have a home of my own to put this in.” My little Hopeful Haven.

"The Big Rock Cafe | PCH 1940s

The Big Rock Cafe opened in 1949 and finally Moonshadows in 1966. Unfortunately The recent Pacific Palisades fire claimed Moonshadows, another iconic building.

Malibu nicknamed “The ‘Bu” by surfers and locals is a beach city in the Santa Monica Mountains region of Los Angeles County, California.

It is known for its Mediterranean climate, its strip of beaches stretching 21 miles along the Pacific Ocean coast, and for its longtime status as the home of numerous affluent Hollywood celebrities and executives. Moonshadows was a destination for travelers and executives planning the next big thing.

The ongoing 2025 Palisades Fire devastated Malibu, with almost all of the beachfront homes near its center destroyed.

"One month ago.
.
That’s when my life changed. “Yeah, we know. We get it.” you’re saying. It’s not breaking news anymore. You know what happened here in Los Angeles. Although, sometimes when a disaster is simply too big to fully wrap your head around, it’s easier to just hone in and see it through one person’s eyes. That’s what I’ve been trying to do with my updates. I’m trying to put one person’s personal connection to it so hopefully you can try and understand a little bit of what so many of us are going through. Day in and day out.
.
Over the last month, I have read so many incredible essays and heartfelt love letters about my beloved Palisades. I know how much I loved it, but it’s amazing to hear how so many others felt the exact same way. It really was a unique and special place. A little oasis within the massive expanse of Los Angeles. And over the last month, what I’ve experienced, and what I’ve read from others, is that we all agree what truly made the Palisades so special — the people.
.
Friends, neighbors and even total strangers of the Palisades have come together in ways some didn’t think possible. Friends propping each other up, sharing drinks, reminiscing and constantly hugging each other asking, “What the F***? Did that really happen??” Neighbors helping each other maneuver the complex and exhaustive trials of FEMA and insurance together, whether in person or WhatsApp chats. Many of which never really spoke before, and are now meeting for coffee or exchanging gallows humor texts. Even total strangers that you meet when you’re standing in lines at a disaster center are forming an instant bond that can’t be described as anything but magical, almost always ending in another (much needed) hug. They are all reminders that the Palisadian’s going through this together are the REASON the Palisades is going to persevere.
.
So as we hit this one month milestone, today is dedicated to my Palisades tribe. These are a few pics of some of us trying to keep each other going. Smiles through the grief. THEY are what gives me the most hope.
.
Because it’s not about the war you’re fighting… it’s about the soldiers you’re fighting with.

"PLEASE SAVE THE DATE Feb 19- March 1
Repost from @craigkrullgallery
•
In the ongoing aftermath of one of the worst disasters in the history of Los Angeles, Craig Krull Gallery seeks to directly benefit the artists affected by the fires with an exhibition of their works, for which they will receive 100% of the proceeds. This exhibition idea began as a direct fire relief effort, but quickly evolved into an opportunity to share personal stories and artistic responses to this moment in our collective experience. The exhibition will include artwork pre- and post fires, interpretive and story telling wall text by each artist, and a gallery talk with the artists on Saturday, February 22 at 2pm, moderated by Hannah Sloan. The exhibition coincides with Frieze week. If you, or someone you know, is an artist impacted by the fires, please share this information.

The show is up @bergamotsantamonica in the former Building Bridges space F2

"Dear friends, family, and kind-hearted strangers,Help Me Rebuild After Losing Everything in the Pacific Palisades Fire

I’m reaching out during one of the hardest times in my life. A devastating fire swept through my apartment complex in Pacific Palisades, destroying everything I owned. I wasn’ in Los Angeles during the evacuation and wasn’t able to grab anything from my apartment. Helplessly, I watched first my car and then home burn down live on TV, —all my staff, my clothes, cherished memories, and the equipment that supports my livelihood as a professional surfer and business owner—was gone in an instant.

I’m heartbroken but determined to rebuild. However, starting over from scratch is overwhelming, and I can’t do it alone. Your support can help me purchase essential items—clothing, basic living supplies, and the equipment I need to continue my work and passion in surfing

Every contribution, big or small, makes a world of difference. If you can’t donate, sharing this message would mean so much to me.

Thank you for your generosity, love, and belief in my journey toward recovery.

"How I miss this human being right now… Losing the Day House in the fire has made me realize just how much comfort it gave me—because we created it together. When he was alive, no matter where I was, as long as I was with him, I felt at home. And when he was gone, the house we rebuilt together became my sanctuary—the one place where I still felt safe, protected, connected to him.

Now, with no home, no familiar walls, no space infused with our memories, I feel his absence in a whole new way. It’s a reminder of something he always told me—people make the home. And in a way, after he left, that house became his spirit, the closest thing to having him here.

While looking through his phone for old photos of the house to help design the rebuild, I stumbled upon this photo—a selfie he took that I never knew existed. A little gift from the past, a reminder that even now, in this new chapter of uncertainty, he’s still here in some way.

And in true “Walter” fashion, his spirit is still here—helping me build a house from scratch, something he would have found absolutely thrilling… because, to this badass man, starting from nothing and creating something great was always the most exhilarating part 

So, I’m going to tackle rebuilding our family home in his spirit. With that same fire, that same drive, that same unshakable belief that from the ashes, something even greater can rise. ❤️

"Introducing our latest coffee drop: Super Scooper – a bold tribute to the real-life heroes of the Los Angeles Palisades and Eaton fires.

Named after the legendary CL-415 “Super Scooper” aircraft, this drop honors the fearless pilots and crews who battle wildfires from the sky. These amphibious planes can scoop up 1,620 gallons (6,140 liters) of water in just 12 seconds and drop it with precision over raging fires. Built for extreme conditions, the CL-415 is a symbol of resilience, agility, and unwavering courage—just like the people who fly them.

For those who soar into danger when others seek safety—this brew’s for you.

"Now that the fires are 100% contained — LA, I’m not sure I have the words. It’s been such a sad, heavy and confusing time. I’m just so sorry and deeply heartbroken for my city. It’s beyond comprehension and truly unbelievable how reality can shift so drastically, so quickly. The utter devastation from the fires, and implications for individuals and our city are unimaginable. While I’m grateful I’m safe, I’m heartbroken for those communities, people, animals, and wildlife who aren’t as fortunate. To those who have been affected or impacted, please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers during this incredibly difficult time.

I’m an LA native and I love my city so much. LA always has, and always will be, my home. I even have an LA tattoo; my very first tattoo that I got at 19. Pic two is little water baby me in Malibu, a city that is now unrecognizable. My heart has been so heavy seeing the devastation caused by these fires. There’s this element of grief because there are memories made in parts of the city, and in communities, which have been completely wiped. Neighborhoods just vaporized.

Thank you to the brave and incredible first responders who have been working non-stop on the front lines - firefighters, law enforcement, the national guard, paramedics, pilots, mechanics, DWP, etc. They’re the real heroes.

I’m deeply moved by our community coming together, uniting, and supporting one another through this time of hardship. The strength of our community shines brightest as we work toward recovery. When society inevitably begins to move on and focus on the next “thing”, I pray people will continue to donate, volunteer, amplify victims’ stories, foster displaced animals, share resources, and help rebuild communities. I invite you to lead with compassion, kindness, patience, and most importantly - love.

If you are looking for ways to help, I’ve added a highlight where you can find all the resources I’ve shared thus far.

I love you, Los Angeles ❤️ Together, we’ll rise stronger than ever — because that’s the LA way.

"Remembering January 7, 2025
A day marked in memory, where time stood still and left an imprint that will never fade.

Dear Palisades,

A month ago, when the fire broke, I couldn’t fathom what had happened. It was a shock, and my heart ached for the families I’ve known over the years who live here. Their homes, the memories along these roads, the strong sense of community, and the beauty of nature, it all feels like a part of me. 

Palisades has become a second home to me. Driving there feels like driving home. I know exactly where I’m going, naturally navigating the roads, enjoying the beautiful beach from above, and feeling the wind blowing through. These simple moments are when I realize how much this place means to me. 

Dear families I’ve had the privilege of teaching and being part of your musical journey, I am forever truly grateful. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your trust! 

I miss you all, and please know that I’m here if there’s anything I can do. 

We all need some time to heal…until we meet again... ❤️ 

You will be missed. I know you’ll come back stronger. 
And if life’s path has brought you somewhere new, I wish you all the best on your next journey! 

Footage captured during my walk (break) between lessons. I’m glad I took the time to capture these moments, and I’ll cherish them looking back.

With love and hope, 
Jesica ❤️‍

"It’s taken a month for me to finally be able to post something about this. Here I am in full PPE at my brother and sister-in-law’s home in Altadena the day after they started letting people back up. They’re now staying with us until they can find long-term housing. With 2 young kids and 2 dogs, the search has been challenging to say the least. This is just one family’s story.

"It’s been a month since our home and community burned in the Palisades Fire. 

We spent the first three weeks in Long Beach, regulating our nervous systems and creating a safe space for the kids.

Sky zone, nature spaces, play dates with displaced friends, time with cousins and lots of arts n crafts.

The kids’ LemonAID sale was a success and the donations keep trickling in (thank you). The best part was teaching the kids how to transmute pain through creativity.

In addition to caring for the twins, I’ve been doing my darnedest to support my elder neighbors (we had so many). Specifically, I’ve been helping “Grandma Lou,” my 96 year old neighbor who never married or had kids but treated me and mine like family.

@kalinasilverman from @makebigtalk helped us share her @gofundme (link in bio) and so many people have stepped up to help. It’s been heartbreaking and heartwarming, all at the same time.

For the past week, we’ve been back in Santa Monica (close to the affected area and without clean water) and it’s a lot. 

Life and news cycles move on but we’re still deep in it. 

I’m trying to rebuild and create a new sense of “home” for the kids while processing the many layers of grief.

But going back to school (on a new campus) has really amplified the suffering. Everyone in our community has been affected. It’s almost too much to bear.

Today, I got free drinking water and started crying in front of the volunteers. 

As we left, we accidentally drove by many burned homes and my kids witnessed a sliver of the wreckage for the first time. They were shaken and it was only a small fraction of the reality.

I know we’ll all be ok eventually, but right now, we’re really feeling it. 

Everyone’s kindness and support has been overwhelming. Truly, thank you.

Thank you, everyone, for everything.

We feel the love,
Gigi + The Neves Family

"Eaton Fire Aftermath

I am saddened that this had to be the first post of the year.
The LA County Fires of 2025 burned the livelihoods of so many down to the ground, leaving more than 40,000 acres, 16,000 structures and dozens of lives destroyed. It was by far the most destructive event the city has ever gone through.
I personally experienced a prolonged power outage and extremely hazardous air quality for days, but so many people had to abruptly leave their homes and belongings behind, and for some, for good. That’s a scary thought, I thought, and it can happen to anyone.
Much anticipated rainfall came after almost 9 months of drought, just 2 weeks shy of the start of the fires. It helped with containment of fires and lifted some of the road blocks, so the residents were finally able to return to their homes, now looking nothing like how they left it.
I had a privilege to volunteer in Altadena with @dj2high @parukaokay @yoshihiro_imae @ringdabingo thanks to generous support from @pocarisweatusa to donate and distribute #PocariSweat to the first responders in the burn zones and had an opportunity to document the aftermath.
My heart goes out to everyone affected, especially to those who stand up to do what they can in support of the community. The City of Angels really showed resilience and compassion in the wake of this unprecedented catastrophe.

"From rare snowstorms ❄️ in Houston to the devastating wildfires  in Los Angeles, this January has been a whirlwind for many. But through it all, communities came together, resilience was tested, and new opportunities for change and progress emerged. This month has been a true testament to adaptability, strength, and transformation.

Personally, this month brought unexpected hurdles in planning and execution, demanding schedules to meet multiple needs simultaneously, and moments of uncertainty in my trajectory of life and of business. I’ve had many doubts, many conversations of these doubts and stressed myself out more than I’d like to admit, but also pushed my limits more than I  thought I could because I’ve leaned on the people who reminded me of my strength & that I wasn’t alone. If nothing else, this month has shown me that even in the chaos, there’s clarity, growth, and love.

Closing out January with gratitude—for the lessons learned, the connections made, and the road ahead—embracing the challenges and here’s to even bigger things. ✨",1.14061E+14,https://www.instagram.com/p/DF1NPsRyjzc/,2025-02-09 00:07:09+00:00

"Thank you to my cousin for this beautiful painting of the Tavidian residence. 

It’s been a month—a month filled with heartache, discomfort, chaos, and so many questions about the next step. But through it all, I’ve felt an overwhelming amount of love and protection. The love and support from friends, my incredible team at @knxnews, my co-workers, and even “strangers” who’ve now become like family has been humbling.

This experience has taught me to release my discomfort with receiving and to truly embrace  receiving with gratitude. I’m doing my best to care for my heart, mind, and soul during this time. It hasn’t been easy moving from one short-term rental to another while searching for a more stable place to stay as we rebuild. But thanks to  angels and kind souls we’ve found a home to move into soon.

To everyone who’s been there for us—thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your support means everything. And to those who’ve lost their comfort, their homes, their memories, and their stability—I’m sending you so much love. I hope the pieces fall into place for all of us with grace and ease.

"Relics:  Introduction to Memories

My plan was to kick off my series Relics on Substack on January 12, 2025.  I spent the month of December planning out my content schedule and compiled a list of music for upcoming writings and reels.  I sorted through boxes of pictures and old newspaper clippings, watched family videos and did a deep dive into my family tree. 

I was full of inspiration and felt the spark of creativity as I sat in different coffee shops around Cypress, Texas, preparing for this series even after a long day at the office. 

Then things took an unexpected turn.

" I’ve been sitting on this short essay since the election, and it applies now more than ever. As we witness extreme wildfire events like the Palisades and Eaton fires in tandem with our government seemingly going up in flames, I argue that the flammability of our socio-ecological systems are not all too different; both are at risk due to legacies of poor management and extractive capitalism, both endanger the working class, and both can be made to be more resilient to change - as long as we adjust our relationship to it. 

This is me trying out a different style compared to my typical scientific writing (psst: our recently accepted manuscript on my research will be available soon). As a scientist, I align with groups like Extinction Rebellion who argue that scientists can no longer afford to be complacent or “unbiased” when it comes to the climate crisis or capitalism, things that touch so many of our lives and our study systems. 

I don’t really have the time for “content generation” or crazy formatting, so enjoy this notes app stream of consciousness - after all, I’m just a girl!!!! ‍

"My grandmother, Jan Day, always said, “You never know what it’s like to walk in somebody’s shoes.” Now, I understand that on a level I never could have imagined.

When you hear about natural disasters happening around the world, you never actually think it will happen to you—until it does. You watch the news, see the devastation, and feel sympathy, but it still feels distant. Then, in an instant, your life is the one up in flames, and you’re the one standing in the ashes, trying to figure out what comes next.

Losing everything in the fire—the home I built, the memories, even the clothes that made me feel like me—has been a humbling, surreal experience. When your entire life is reduced to ashes overnight, you realize how much the little things matter. The feeling of putting on something beautiful, something that makes you recognize yourself again, is something I’ll never take for granted.

Thank you to the incredible brands that have gifted us fire victims brand-new designer clothes. I keep getting compliments on these pieces, and I can’t tell you how much it means to walk out of the house feeling like myself again. When life strips you down to nothing, kindness has a way of dressing you back up—not just in fabric, but in confidence, dignity, and hope.

"In a flash a month has passed since the #PalisadesFire and Eaton Fires erupted in Los Angeles. Cliche but it’s been an eternity and flash simultaneously. I was going to write something on Feb. 7 but was finishing the laundry shed I abandoned mid-roofing to speed back to LA when the fires began. Ironically the shed got rained on twice and leaked before I could finish it post fire siege.I remember the winds picking up in the Mojave at 2am Jan 7th, and peering out into the desert night, twinkling and clear stars under the bone dry breeze, the light pollution if the Inland Empire and greater SoCal sprawl staring back at me from the periphery of civilization. It was quiet, save for the rustle of creosote, but also foreboding and I felt a pit it my stomach. 

18 hours later I was on the beach in Malibu, dodging flying debris and getting sandblasted until my face was red by blowing debris. I photographed the Palisades Fire for scene setter, working to get the Santa Monica pier in frame, but none of the telephoto long exposure images turned out. Despite weighing down the biggest tripod I had with 20lb of bags, it was simply too windy and unstable to make a proper long exposure. I cranked up the ISO, grabbed my fastest lens, and went to available light/handheld. 

Honestly, I was scared to go into the Palisades Fire. I worried powerlines would go down on PCH stranding anybody past Temescal/Sunset in Malibu for the night without going the long way (which ended up happening) and after being flushed out to the beach by flame in 2018 at the Woolsey, I didn’t want a repeat. As I trudged into the wind back to my truck, my soggy shorts were perfectly dry in minutes after leaving the surf, and the Eaton Fire began to rip through Altadena. Being more comfortable with the grid layout there and multiple escape routes, I drove through a mostly abandoned I-10 across LA and into the SGV, into the inferno and the burning McDonald’s. The rest became history, a history that I wish never happened. - SP",3001340,https://www.instagram.com/p/DF3cE_mToPK/,2025-02-09 20:55:15+00:00
"With everything upside down in Malibu since the #Franklinfire & #Palisadesfire I set up a space for myself to work at home. My commute times went from a beautiful curvy ocean ride on PCH for 25 min to a now 1-2 hour commute each way with two freeways and a canyon with managing boulders tumbling on the road because of the rain. Oh California  For those of you who know me, I love driving ️️️ but I won’t endure monotony and wasting creative time. So I’ll be homey working on this commission and while I figure out what the best option is about my beloved Malibu space and oasis. New things are in the horizon! Show me this silver linings universe! Shift up! 

Oh and I will be enjoying a whole new set of brushes for this piece so, very happy about that! Small joys!

Crazy that this is a major progress shot. This is after 300 bags of debris removed. When some fires burn down a house it burns the wood and leaves just an about everything else. Sometimes it burns everything. We have atleast 700 more bags of debris to remove. And this is just the first of seven structures we will be cleaning out and rebuilding. Yet the bureaucracy won’t give us a place to dump it. So we have massive piles of bags just waiting to go. I’ll be contracting this property as well others. So tragic. Such a stalled and slow and stupid process. #PALISADESFIRE,220949533,https://www.instagram.com/p/DF3reLjStyA/,2025-02-09 23:09:45+00:00

"tonight Feb 9th A ritual circo initiatory experience for the people ~ 

We had been putting this evening together and were ready to roll the week the flames broke out. 

In the wake of the fires, Força Feminina will be held February 9th at Corazon (125 S Topanga Canyon Blvd) in the wake of the fires that swept through Los Angeles and Topanga Canyon.

Força Feminina & Le Sacred Cirque will carry on—not as first imagined, but somehow even more purposeful.

 Superplay will weave the ground for mythopoetic circo artistry and announcements of ancient mayan and astrological prophecy, a sanctuary for mourning, dreaming, and celebrating the enduring spirit of this land and its people.

Set and props by @raehausart 

@_devsmith will provide soul gratifying delights.

$$$ will be supporting @corazontopanga, @zorthianranch, and the artists - many of which have been directly impacted. 

We will also now be adding a segment to our opening ceremony to honor the @heat_hawks_topangacanyon and other volunteers who risked everything to save Topanga Canyon. 

Sliding scale, reach out for volunteer shifts, free for anyone who has lost their home in the fires <3

"It has been over a month since we evacuated from the Palisades Fire, yet looking back, it still feels like it just happened. We have returned home three times, and each time, the feeling has been overwhelmingly heavy. Memories from the past unfold like scenes from a movie—the neighbor excitedly showing us their newly purchased car, the beautifully decorated snowy scene at a friend’s house for Christmas, and the neighbor’s incredibly dedicated haunted house for Halloween…

We are grateful to God that our home survived, though it has brought many challenges due to extensive damage and repairs. In the new year, we have learned to be even more grateful, to cherish what we have, and to live in the moment. ❤️

"""""""In our darkest moments, a light waits to be found. That’s when we discover who we truly are.""""

The Palisades fire wasn’t just flames consuming the landscape—it was a test of resilience, a stark reminder of how fragile and powerful we are at once. When everything feels like it’s falling apart, we’re forced to confront what truly matters. It’s in the chaos that courage rises, in the ashes that strength is reborn.

Disasters don’t just destroy; they reveal. They show us who we are, what we stand for, and how we come together. In loss, we find unity. In fear, we find bravery. And in devastation, we find hope—not because we have to, but because we must.

I have to believe that this is a friendly universe. That the joke, in the end, can’t be on those who spent their lives building something meaningful. That there is something hidden here—a gift waiting to be revealed. Because if I don’t, the weight of it all would be unbearable.

To everyone who fought, who endured, and who continues to rebuild—you are the light in the darkness. And maybe, just maybe, that light will lead us to something greater..

"Chad Comey looks into the charred remains of the apartment complex where his family lived for three generations. 

Like so many other Californians, Chad's family had no fire insurance on their apartment. Insurance companies have been leaving this area, or pricing policies in a way that many families can't afford the coverage. Chad cares for his two disabled parents, and says insurance just wasn't feasible for them. ""They're living Social Security check to Social Security check.""

The exterior of the aparment complex was covered by California's ""Fair Plan"" -- the insurance policy of last resort. It's unclear when or how much that will pay out to them. 

Now, they've got no home, and are living temporarily with some friends.

"Driving into the Palisades Fire zone yesterday was absolutely surreal. Houses completely destroyed were standing next to perfectly normal ones. A gas station on one side was completely charred while another one just across the street was intact. I finally understood why some people chose to stay and fight the fire themselves. It was obviously so unpredictable, you could’ve totally believed your house would be spared. I’ve never seen anything like it. 

But what moved me the most was all the @wckitchen food trucks lined up on Sunset Boulevard distributing *free* food for the crews and volunteers working on getting the neighborhood back to normal. I watched dozens of folks get served with a smile and a “so grateful for what you’re doing” comment. And no tips allowed. It was their way to serve the community. 

So much kindness there! And oh so needed in this current climate of so much hate in the news/government. I was moved to tears. Goodness can and will prevail! We just have to stir it within us and share it with one another daily. May these folks be our role models! ✨❤️

"Even though Chuck Foster and Pam Nye lost everything they owned in the LA wildfires, because they'd paid $5000 a year for Farmers insurance that included wildfire coverage, they felt they'd be made whole. But when they talked with a Farmers rep recently, they were told they had flood insurance, not fire. Ever since, the couple has been living out of a hotel paid for by FEMA, and they've been on the phone trying to get clarity as to what their policy actually covers. They're part of the chaotic, complicated state of homeowners insurance in California, where companies have been pulling out, and the state's insurance plan of last resort is overstuffed and overstretched.

"In the midst of the devastation caused by the California #wildfires, one of our talented freelancers, Reese Cuevas, beautifully captured the emotional journey of family and friends who traveled from out of state to support their loved ones, who are parishioners at @saintelizabethschool in #Altadena. Together, they sifted through the remnants of a fire, uncovering the last remnants of cherished memories among the ashes.⁠
⁠
The haunting scenes of burned-out cars and charred belongings tell a story of loss, but amidst the wreckage emerged a glimmer of hope. A few precious religious items and pieces of jewelry were found, symbols of faith and resilience that remind us even in darkness, there is light.⁠

These striking images serve as a reminder of God's presence among us, the power of community, and the strength of the human spirit in the face of hardship. Let’s cherish the moments that bind us together and honor the journey of healing that lies ahead. ⁠

"Rebuilding Resilient concrete Homes After a Devastating Fire: What You Need to Know! 

Rebuilding after fires is not just about restoring what was lost—it’s an opportunity to create a home that’s safe, resilient, and future-ready.

Building for Fire Resilience

Concrete Type 1 Construction:

•Non-combustible: Concrete doesn’t ignite, offering unparalleled fire resistance.
•High heat resistance: Maintains structural integrity under extreme temperatures.
•Durable: A sustainable investment designed to last generations.

Advanced Fire Suppression Systems

•Automatic fire defense: Sprinklers activate instantly to stop fires before they spread.
•Dual protection: Deploys water and fire-retardant foam for maximum safety.
•Blue Roof Design: Integrates exterior sprinklers, fire-retardant coatings, and smart weather monitoring for real-time fire mitigation.

Exterior Fire-Resistant Coatings

•Acts as a barrier, preventing flames from penetrating the home’s exterior.
Metal Roofs
•Fire-resistant and durable, designed to reduce ember penetration risks.

Lessons from the 2018 Malibu Fires

The Malibu fires underscored the need for innovative solutions. During this time, we developed the Blue Roof Design, which expedited rebuilding by meeting safety codes and bypassing roadblocks.

Recognized by the AIA, our homes incorporated:

•ICF concrete for unmatched fire resistance.
•Integrated sprinklers for interior and exterior safety.
•Sustainable systems for long-term resilience.

A Safer, Brighter Future:
Rebuilding after loss is hard, but with the right materials and technology, your home can be beautiful—and resilient.

Contact us today to begin designing a home that protects your family and future.

In response to the devastating L.A. County wildfires, the Beverly Hills City Council has modified its urgency ordinance to align with Governor Newsom’s Executive Order, expanding emergency housing options for displaced families.

Key Updates:
- No max rent cap for single-family homes with 4+ bedrooms in 90210 (if not rented/offered for rent in the past year).
- Waiver in effect until March 8, 2025.
- Short-term rental restrictions suspended for 90 days in Beverly Hills.
- No Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) or business tax on eligible emergency rentals.

This action will help those that were affected by the wildfires find stable housing during this critical time. If you or someone you know needs emergency housing, check local listings and official resources.

 Together, we rebuild.

"Indiegogo campaign - ""California wildfire strike teams""

We need your support - please like, share, donate.

Creating multiple volunteer strike teams to fight California wildfires - to protect human lives and health, nature, property, and the normal way of living without fear, smog, and evacuations. 

We need your help to buy used fire engines, each with at least a 1000-gallon tank, to equip and deliver them to California. 

It will be an alternative and independent powerful force that will assist local firefighters and hotshots to overcome fast-spreading fires with additional fire engines, men and water or will protect places where no one comes to help. 

The condition of wildfire management system in California is highly critical, especially in LA where it is incompetent and even looks like a sabotage, and it will not change on its own quickly. Something must be done about it before it is not too late again.

"Liv started her new school today. This was her SECOND first day of Second Grade. She was fearless. Witnessing her bravery made me feel brave. 

We found a place to land that is going to be better than I could have imagined. We are taking it day by day and haven’t completed much dreaming beyond that. Moving in real time, with the weight and the seismic loss, but also the immeasurable kindness from friends and new friends, near and far. It led us here, and after a day like today - Liv’s first in this new place many miles from home - I know it’s all going to be OK. 

I just have to look at how amazing Liv is handling it and follow her lead. And feel the gratitude of so much loving kindness that we have encountered.

"This is the most iconic house in Pacific Palisades. Located 100 feet above Sunset Boulevard, between Brooktree and Chautauqua (which is where his entrance once stood), it belongs to the architect Robert Bridges, who also designed and build the home. The house, which has been in the movie “Charlie’s Angels”, was destroyed in the #PalisadesFire , and now has a huge American flag hanging in what is left of the property. This is for me the best heart warming display of strength and resilience. Exactly what us, Palisadians are in need right now.

"Link in bio to share and donate  we are almost at goal!

This was my first time back since the wildfires decimated the palisades. Seeing the damage first hand overwhelmed me with emotions. 

After searching through the rubble hoping to find any last memory of my parents store, my dad takes a seat on the bench in front of the remains and optimistically says “It is what it is, shit happens”

Although the pharmacy isn’t physically there, it will remain alive in our memories as our family business. There are brighter days ahead. I’m thankful my parents are alive and healthy, and that my dad can find the upside to this situation, joking like he always does 

Thank you to all of our friends and family and loyal community of customers for the words of support and thoughtful donations. It has been amazing to see how many customers have been positively impacted by my parent’s business  we will back!!!

"What if life knocks you down - not to break you, but to rebuild you into something stronger?

We lost our home in the Pacific Palisades fire.

And now, I’m learning…

Loss doesn’t just take - it refines.

Pain doesn’t just hurt - it teaches.

And true strength isn’t about powering through -
it’s about surrendering to what’s real,
even when it hurts.

What if the hardest moments aren’t meant to break you, but to shape you?

To burn away the distractions and reveal what truly holds you up?

This is for anyone who’s been knocked down and is searching for their way back up.

Let’s walk through it together.

"What goes into a house and studio? Years of hard work, saving, planning, moving, designing, decorating, and many, many memories created and stored within its walls. Every year, for 11 years, I would plan and prepare for each fire season and emerge intact. This year, Mother Nature had something else in mind, a lesson in “impermanence,” with single-digit humidity and 70-90mph winds. There was no preparation or defense that would have saved the house and studio in those conditions. Not even the fire department would dare to enter and defend the houses under those conditions  The past is ash, vaporized by 2,500+ degree fire turned into a blast furnace by the 70mph winds. The future is filled with promise and opportunity. I have decided to rebuild. Wish me luck. #palisadesfire",928991975,https://www.instagram.com/p/DF8GzKQJ-3o/,2025-02-11 16:25:31+00:00

Currently in Phase 1, teams are focused on removing hazardous waste, while Phase 2 will address ash, debris, and burned structures to prepare properties for reconstruction. #PalisadesFire #DisasterRecovery #RebuildTogether

"This live edge dining table had a ton of character. The top was made from a single slab of premium claro walnut, and the wishbone table legs were custom made, brass plated and polished. My favorite part about this table was the bullet lodged into the top side. 

It’s always fun guessing how, when and why that bullet got there. Ultimately, this table perished in the palisades fire.

"Paulo’s Second Bit of Advice - A smile can still be found amongst the carnage.
.
By now you’ve seen SO many photos of fire destruction. Image after image of carnage and pure desolation. The scope of it all instills so much sadness that after a while it starts to make you numb. I’ve visited my former home —what I now dub “the rubble”— four times now, this last time with my FEMA inspector to confirm the damage. Uh yeah, pretty sure it’s damaged. And each time Paulo witnesses what happens to me as I shrink into myself and absorb the total loss of my former life. It’s so much to take in that it’s overwhelming. You never get used to it. Finally, that’s when Paulo decided to jump into action.
.
Paulo is an emotional support hamster for a reason. Much like Perrito from the amazing Puss in Boots movie, he knows exactly what to do and is there when he’s needed. He grew sick of my sadness, just staring at the rubble and feeling hollow. So he decided to wobble up and block my view wherever I was looking. Paulo knows damn well he can always make me smile. How can he not? I mean, look at him. He’s adorable. And you know what, it worked. I smiled. Even amongst all my rubble, I smiled. This was when I realized the lesson he was trying to teach me. There can always be something to smile about, even amongst so much destruction. Oh Paulo, you are so wise.
.
So that is Paulo’s bit of advice for today. Even when things look completely hopeless and desolate, there can always be something that can bring a moment of comfort. All you have to do is find it. Luckily for me, I have Paulo. Hopefully you can find your Paulo too.

"What a journey… returning to the Palisades to bid farewell to our special family home, destroyed by the fires. 

Nothing could prepare us for the confronting scenes we encountered and the profound heartache felt as we witnessed the unimaginable devastation that hit the Palisades community. 

Thank you to all the incredible Angelenos who came out in their droves to help and give aid! Strangers and dear friends alike showering us with countless, unprovoked and much needed hugs and unwavering support. 

Early days but we will indeed rise from these ashes like a mighty phoenix - and be stronger for it! 

It’s eerie that ‘Toxic Town’ a show I recently completed, is about to be released on Netflix.  It is based on the UK’s biggest environmental scandal and the mass poisoning that beset Corby following the mismanagement of toxic waste removal. Let’s pray every necessary health and safety protocol is being adhered to when removing the toxic waste from the Palisades & Altadena!

"A month after the fires, the smoke has cleared, but the loss is still raw. I’ve walked through the remains of homes I spent years designing—places where families celebrated life, where carefully curated details turned houses into homes. Now, they exist only in memory and scattered fragments of what was left behind.
In some cases, those fragments were eerily intact—pottery vessels, blackened but unbroken. Metal barstools, still lined up at the ghost of a kitchen island, the kitchen itself reduced to rubble. Objects meant to be lived with, loved, and passed down through generations, now standing as the last evidence of spaces that no longer exist.

Losing my work this way has been emotional in a way I wasn’t prepared for. But that pales in comparison to the heartbreak of watching people I love lose everything.

The devastation is profound, yet so too is LA’s resilience. If there is one thing Angelenos do well in the face of catastrophe, it’s help our neighbors. I’m proud of the way my colleagues and friends in the design industry have come together to help. I know we will all have an important role to play in the rebuilding of beloved communities. My hope is that our heartbreak and deep respect for LA’s landscape and the character of its diverse communities will guide our efforts in the years to come.

this is our neighbor’s home- the tall green pines still stand strongly between us, not dividing us of our land vs their land, rather connecting us. i saw so much beauty in this fractured glass— glass that had likely been there since the 50-60’s. a container for so much life, conversation, music, celebratory + mundane moments… it’s all been released now and a new container will be built. in this moment i honored all that i did not know, all that was before my time. we don’t have to physically be a part of something to love it.  energy is infinite + undefined.

This deal wasn’t without its unexpected challenges. In the middle of escrow, the Palisades fires in LA started, out of nowhere, causing serious complications with insurance coverage. The fires impacted the buyers ability to secure the right coverage, and we had to navigate a lot of uncertainty. Thankfully, the seller’s insurance company stepped up and worked with us to secure a great rate so the buyers could move forward and get into their new home! 
I’m beyond thrilled for this wonderful family to start making memories in their new space. It’s been such a rewarding journey and I’m grateful to have been part of it every step of the way. 
If you or anyone you know is looking to buy or sell, I’d love to help! Referrals are the highest complement, and I truly appreciate each one!

- Drive carefully: check tires, brakes & wipers. Roads will be slick.

- Avoid flooded areas: just 6 inches of water can sweep you away. Turn around, don’t drown!

- Stay clear of downed power lines: keep 100+ feet away & call 911.

- Stay away from riverbeds & flood channels.

"This past month has broken my community in ways I never imagined.  But even in the heartbreak, we kept going. We kept showing up - because when everything else feels uncertain, commitment, purpose, and the people we care about are what keep us grounded. 

I’ve heard, “I didn’t want to bother you.” And while I appreciate the thought, I need you to know - you are not bothering me. I’ve loved every message and call, and have loved hearing from past and future clients.

Connection is everything. The work we do, the trust we build, the lives we help shape - it all matters most… now more than ever. We are H.E.R.E. We are stronger. More committed than ever.

If you’ve been waiting to reach out, don’t. We’re ready, and we’re better than ever. Let’s make your next move happen.✨

"Another poignant memory from the community of Tahitian Terrace where all homes in the community were incinerated on January 7, 2025 alongside those in the adjoining Pacific Palisades Bowl.
The personal touch of the rock collections that were organized on each step of this home were so like something that I’d wind up with after gathering favorites during walks and hikes. 
Someday, I hope to connect with homeowners and residents who’ve lost so much and share my images with them.

"A sustainable GREAT PARK to replace Santa Monica Airport when it closes in 2029 will reclaim MILLIONS of gallons of lost stormwater runoff.   

Millions of gallons of rain water is entirely lost at Santa Monica Airport -everytime - it rains. A Great Park to replace the nearly 200 acres of asphalt with porous park soil that will reclaim that water and return it to our underground aquifer for future use.

Parks play a crucial role in water reclamation by providing space to implement green infrastructure like rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable surfaces, which can capture and filter stormwater runoff, allowing it to slowly infiltrate the ground, effectively replenishing groundwater and reducing strain on freshwater sources; essentially acting as a natural water retention system, especially in urban areas where large impervious surfaces contribute to excessive runoff.

I've been terrible at updating, so just to be clear: our house is miraculously fine, with the fire coming within 1,000 feet of it. This photo is the new view out of our window. We are so lucky and cannot ever thank the firefighters enough. 

For those interested, I've just posted the full odyssey on my blog, which you can read on the site (Link in bio).

Getting fully back to work feels good for the soul and I'm so thankful for all of your notes of support. January felt like the longest year and we're relieved to have it behind us.

"On January 7th, I left home with my camera on a whim that I might see something extreme, based on the high wind weather warning that morning on the news. As I drove down the 405s fwy, I saw a plume of smoke rising out over the Palisades. After turning on the radio I learned that a fire had just broken out on Sunset Blvd, so I decided to get off at the next exit after Sunset and head directly for the beach. I was not prepared for what I was about to see… 

I have lived in Los Angeles my entire life. The last time I saw a fire that upset me as much was the Woolsey Fire in 2018, but from the get go, this was DIFFERENT. I parked my car and literally sprinted down to the ocean. My heart hurt, and so did my lungs, even with a mask. People were crowding down on the strand and the Santa Monica Beach in astonishment. I took some photos and hurried off to see my Dad in Torrance. By the time I arrived, he showed me a video of a bulldozer crushing abandoned cars out of the way on Sunset Blvd, where I had just been only a mile or so away. I was in disbelief. I think we all were. 

It’s been a little over a month and I still have my animal carrier by the door, my apartment is a complete mess, and my mind has not recovered, nor will our city ever be the same. So many people I know have lost what can only be surmised as priceless pieces of their lives. Everyday I think how I can live my life with more intention, how I can give back to my community in a valuable way, how we can work to prevent something like this from happening again. To those who have lost so much, and to even those who only watched in horror, we will rebuild, and while it will be different, what’s come to pass will not be forgotten. I stand in solidarity with my community at large, and I promise I will make more purposeful how and why I use my camera, because never before has truth needed a larger stage in which to be seen. Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day, but love isn’t all about gifts and candy, it’s about being a support, understanding the pain of others, and standing by those in need.❤️ #eatonfire #palisadesfire",234087430,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGCTjyzpGKv/,2025-02-14 02:12:27+00:00
"Utter devastation. 

The crumble of books, pages swirling like paste. Chimneys left standing, the lone remnant of a home, mocking the roof, walls, windows that have faded into mud. Burnt cars frozen in time - as if they were left behind decades ago. Entire neighborhoods vanished. Christmas decorations strung, frozen grey amid the void of color on a tree. The smell of ash and smoke lingering, hovering over the skeleton of homes and refusing to leave. 

“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.” Matthew 7. 

It all fades away. Only Jesus does not.

We had them brass plated and polished by an outfit in Los Angeles and they were truly beautiful. These legs are common now and available off the shelf, but that was not the case in 2019-2020.

"Just as Maui gave a motivational speech to Moana, here is my motivational speech to Instagram. It’s called “May we Try”:✨

May we try(!) to believe in our ourselves. To believe in our inner strength, to believe we can sift through discouragement and persevere to something that is good.

May we try(!) to remember that we have gone through hard times before, to remember what helps us through the hardest of times. 

May we try(!) to cling to the people and things who support us, to cling to hope and to the possibility of hope. 

And may we also try (!) to let ourselves laugh, smile, and be lifted up—whether that’s by Disney characters, a favorite song, or a movie that sparks joy. (Thanks, @therock, for this timely and hope-infused reminder from Moana 2!)

I invite you to share what helps you when you’re feeling discouraged or overwhelmed? Drop your go-to tips in the comments! I’ll go first. This song! My 5yr-old and I have been listening to it on repeat.

Let’s encourage and uplift each other, together. 

Sending you all warmth and care,
Robyn

PS my original post had the phrasing “Now is the time” instead of “May we try”. I intentionally decided to change it because I realized 1.) MLK used that phrasing in his “I have a dream” speech and I wanted to give full honor to him and his words by not using the exact phrasing that he used and 2.) “May we try” is more in line with me and what I was hoping to convey. :) I will post a reel soon on this same speech!!

"Honoring the history of iconic landmarks that have now been lost to the Palisades fire. While these places are no longer with us, their stories continue to live on:

"My grandmother, Jan Day, used to take me to Carbon Beach to search for wish rocks—stones that spoke to you, carrying the energy of your deepest desires. You’d make a wish, hold onto that rock as a reminder, and work hard to make it a reality. A small but powerful symbol to always reach for the stars. After she passed away we continued this tradition with our @jafracosmetics friends ❤️

After the love of my life passed away a few years ago, I became obsessed with finding heart-shaped rocks on Carbon Beach. We scattered his ashes at sea from a boat in front of Carbon Beach in front of the Day House, and every heart-shaped rock I found felt like a message—a sign to keep believing in love, to honor the past while looking ahead to the future.

Then the fire came.

The house where we had built our life, the home that held his spirit, the place where I had found so much comfort after losing him—gone. Reduced to ash. And just like that, the world as I knew it burned away for the second time. I realized it would be a very long time before I could walk Carbon Beach and look for heart shaped rocks again. 

Two days ago, my friend @giordanellatoddr posted the mother of all heart rocks that he found in Palm Beach. I saw it and immediately started plotting a completely legal heist to fly to Florida, “borrow” it indefinitely, and bring it back where it obviously belonged. (Don’t worry, Todd, your rock is safe… for now .)

But then last night, as I was making mashed potatoes (incidentally Walter had taught me how to make these), I pulled out the biggest heart-shaped potato I have ever seen.

Life doesn’t always give us what we ask for in the way we imagine. It doesn’t let us hold onto the things we think will last forever. But sometimes, in the midst of destruction, it gives us something else—a sign, a reminder, a reason to keep believing.

Maybe the love we lose never really leaves us. Maybe it just finds new ways to show up.❤️

Happy Valentines Day, everybody! Here’s to the power of love! ❤️

Today is a rainy day in LA so I’ll give you some Enya as a beautiful soundtrack :)

My name is Asher and I’ve put together a team of artist volunteers who draw homes lost in the fires for free to the home owners (or renters!)

These are a small batch in my part of this beautiful project.

"In 2013 I saw a really cute and very tall guy from across the bar in Santa Monica. I walked straight up to him without thinking and told him exactly how I felt…that he was really cute. And very tall. And the rest is history.

Simultaneously navigating two of the hardest things we’ve been through (IVF and our house burning down) has been… intense. But through it all, not once have I wished to trade places with anyone else. The amount of love I feel every day from so many people, but specifically from this really cute and very tall man is endless✨. My home is wherever he is, and I am so grateful for that. 

Happy Valentines Day @eriks22 ❤️. I love you so much.

"Mudslides on Topanga Canyon Blvd, "" The S Curves"" and beyond,  which usually leads to the ocean. HWY 27 is sludge and slides in the Palisades fire burn scar. 

I moved here 25 years ago when the population was not yet 8k. Now its over 11k. The community members have worked tirelessly to restore once almost extinct fresh water fish species in the creek. The Monarch butterfly population was supported by community-lead pollinator projects. Native seeds and planting workshops, teaching children how to be stewards of the canyon. ⛰️  

I'm thankful native plant seeds were saved from Saddlepeak Farm, which burned, and that @greenerempowerment can help the community with native seeds bombs & more sustainability projects to continue to restore our Canyon and help our pollinator friends   and all the wild animals, birds‍⬛.

 We hug trees and try to live in two worlds...because Topanga Canyon vs the outer world is a reality check.  Now, it is more isolated feeling. 

Right now is shocking...to put it lightly. With our brothers and sisters across all burn areas, still trying to make these ashes make sense, I see acts of kindness & love.

"Last month the California Wildfires vaporized my home, memories, and entire community. I, like all the fire victims,  became ""ghosts"" as our past and the memories attached to our 'things' vanished into ashes. I realize ""stuff"" is more than ""things""; it's hopes, dreams, memories, and hard work. These safety pins are all that's left of my studio and costuming kit. I love the life I built and everyone who is part of ""me"".

My heart broke on Jan 7th as I watched my home burn. But the love and support I have received is boundless and so very much appreciated.

Thank you for holding me together. Happy Valentines Day my loves. ❤️

"The walls are still standing. The lights still flicker on. But inside, time has stopped. Everything is frozen in place, untouched since the day we left, while the world outside was reduced to ash. The house still exists—it’s a house, but not a home. Just an empty shell, holding the remnants of a life that no longer fits here.

The streets are silent. No kids racing on bikes, no wiffle ball games, no dogs barking across fences. Just an eerie stillness, heavy and unnatural. The air is thick, damp without rain, the sky dim and unwelcoming—like even the world itself is mourning what was lost.

Inside, everything is just as it was left. The water bottle, half-full, still sits on the nightstand. The bookend lies fallen and cracked from the rush to leave. Clothes remain scattered on the floor, frozen in the moment they were tossed aside. The brand new toaster oven sits, parts still in plastic. Dishes pile in the sink, my mom’s morning coffee still lingering, a plate with crumbs. Laundry hangs half-finished, and homework rests on the kitchen table. My bathroom drawers pulled out, and the gingerbread house we promised we’d finally decorate still rests in its packaging, untouched. A gingerbread house bought from a grocery store that no longer stands, in a town that no longer exists.

It feels like walking through a memory, except the memory is real, trapped within these walls while everything beyond them has been erased. The town’s not just gone. It’s hollowed out, stripped of the laughter, the routines, the simple moments that made it more than just a place on a map. What’s left is a silence so loud it feels unbearable, stretching across the empty streets, pressing against the house that somehow still stands. But standing isn’t the same as surviving. And coming back doesn’t mean returning—because there’s nothing left to return to. But we will be back. 

Sending so much love now, everyday and always to my community whether you are near or far. 90272 ♾️

"Before & After (swipe)

I went to the Palisades for the first time since the fire.  There is no photograph or video that could have prepared me for the sheer amount of destruction.

After a big cry, I started processing it the way I do, by taking pictures.  It was disorienting to drive around - so many of my usual landmarks are gone. 

I’ll post a few of these over the next few days - the before and the aftermath.

I’m starting off gently with this one.
Sending all my love to my entire Pali community

it’s been a difficult 6 weeks but im so grateful we didn’t rush a decision on where to land. i knew the right place would turn up… grateful we had a cozy home to temporarily nest (♥️ @karahleepoth ) and the best agent w all the insider market news (♥️ @laurenravitzhomes ).
this will be our easiest move in our 13th house history of moving… a new 9 month adventure ‘till Rivas is finished.  we will likely be some of the first to return to the palisades- which will be an extraordinary future endeavor ✨",213420290,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGG1kWgyCAA/,2025-02-15 20:26:35+00:00
"A huge shout out to @thatboardgameguy for putting on an entire game day as a fundraiser for Marcus and me after the #Palisadesfire took away our home, hometown and livelihood. Most of the participants had never even met us before but they know Chris as their valiant board game leader and trusted this cause to be a worthy one. 
We spent the entire afternoon and evening playing games, making friends, fist bumping a baby, drinking hazy IPAs, hourly raffles, a silent auction and eating delicious pizza - lactose intolerance be damned!
Thank you to all who participated and/or donated and for giving us a reason to laugh again.

"After years of selling @nikonusa equipment, it’s finally paid off. On this past Tuesday, I grabbed my Nikon binoculars and drove over the hill from my house to go look at the #palisadesfire for the first time. Unbeknownst to me they weren’t fully working and they had double vision and one lens is completely out of focus. I was kind of bummed, When I got back home, I quickly filled out a warranty claim and shipped it to @nikonusa service. I’m happy report. I got my binoculars back fully working and repaired for no cost after four days. I fully believe that when you get good service, you spread the word and this was definitely one of those cases. Also happy to be friends with some of the Nikon team @pva_1964 @thenikonviking @michaeldionne",212999109,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGHfVmTpdQs/,2025-02-16 02:31:34+00:00

"“I think I miss the garden the most,” Erin shared. And how could she not? This was a space she built with care. They had just set up the raised beds, growing an abundance of fruits, vegetables, and herbs while their loyal dog, Brisby, patrolled for cats and squirrels. It was more than a garden. It was a sanctuary of life, growth, and cherished moments.

As I sketched, I imagined the rustling leaves, the scent of ripe fruit in the air, and the quiet joy of harvesting what was once so lovingly grown. I’m honored to bring it back to life on paper, not just as it was, but as it still exists in her heart.

Here’s to gardens past and future, to the resilience of memories, and to love that continues to grow beyond what we see. ❤️‍

"On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the Palisades Fire.
The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water’s edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded.
“It was just heartbreaking,” said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles.
As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more.
Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea.

"Fire, floods, and earthquakes! 

Temescal Gateway Park was not immune to raging mud flow as the charred canyon received intense rainfall Thursday night.

The heavy runoff surpassed the debris basin upstream, overtaking the road and displacing everything in its path that wasn't bolted down. 

Once the storm passed, staff returned to the canyon to begin a new round of damage inspections. Some buildings that survived the fire now have significant flood damage. The mud flow came down with such force, it pushed a front door off its hinges!

Also notice the high water marks on the buildings.

MRCA Fire Division was able to cut thru the mud with a skid-steer in order to regain vehicle access to the road. There's lots to cleanup and repair!

Fortunately, there was no reported damage from the two earthquakes near Malibu.

"Last night was special on so many levels. My wife and I flew out to show our support of my mentor and dear friend, Jens Lindemann, and to hear him perform Wynton Marsalis' incredible new ""Concerto for Trumpet"". 

Jens and his wife, Jennifer, recently lost everything, including their home, in the Pacific Palisades fires. Watching him pour his emotions into this piece—playing on the very trumpets he was able to save from the fires—was an incredibly powerful experience.

We're so glad we could be there.  Thank you for reminding us how much music can help us through some of the hardest parts of life.

"Got my panda pot/plant from Palisades  took it home for a forever keepsake. Our store was lucky enough to have survived but as you know most of the homes, schools and businesses in the surrounding area did not. I’m not sure what kind of luck that is. My favorite low key spot I’d slip out the back door to, Palisades Garden Cafe, survived! Shocking, it was my go to spot for quick breakfast. There is smoke damage and ash every where in the store because the smoke made it through the cracks of our front door and skylight. All windows, doors and walls intact though! Our store will not be re opening in Palisades but we are interested in still having a west side store. For now you can find me for shopping at 420 N.

"In-between fighting the fires in the Palisades, he ran home to Altadena to try and save his mom's house. Sadly, his mother, and both his sisters, lost their homes too. As we walk through this disaster together, we all have our stories to share. So proud of my little one for taking her favorite @sidecardoughnuts to @lafdstation69 this morning, where we met some of our extraordinary heroes, and the fire station dog, Chewy. She then helped a homeowner retrieve film from a garage filled with mud in her colorful rain boots, bringing just a bit of cheer to the sadness. We were able to transport a beloved chair from an unsafe home to a new location for the owners, and facilitate a few more sandbags for delivery.

"That morning after the Palisades fire, I had exactly three seconds of normal before reality hit.

Our home? Gone.
My office? Gone.
Our community? Up in flames.

But here's the plot twist: In our most vulnerable moment, something extraordinary happened. Friends showed up unasked. Our kids became our heroes. Strangers became family.

What I learned about community and resilience in those days? It's reshaping everything I thought I knew about business and life.

Because while we can't choose when everything changes, we can choose what we build from those changes.

And what we're building? It's bigger than anything I could have imagined.

"Pasadena - Senator Sasha Renée Pérez issued the following statement on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ decision to forgo additional soil testing following debris removal and topsoil excavation:

“Fire victims deserve to know their property is safe before rebuilding. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ decision to reject the communities’ calls for additional soil testing after debris removal and topsoil excavation is completely unacceptable. 

“From past wildfires, we know that toxins and carcinogens can be found in soil deeper than six inches. It is incomplete and irresponsible to limit the remediation to six inches without checking for additional health hazards.

“The Eaton and Palisades fire victims must not be subjected to hidden cancers and illnesses from toxins lurking in the ground.

“I call on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reverse its decision and truly fulfill its vital mission of helping fire victims recover and rebuild with confidence in a safe environment.”

"Here are the homes I’ve done in the last few days. Each one unique and memorable. 

I certainly spend the most time on homes with flowers, shrubs and trees - as I want to make sure I capture the personality of the home and not just the structure. 

These are all homes lost in the fires. 

I am still taking submissions for homes - these are all offered free of charge to anyone who’s lost their primary home. 

If you want a drawing of a home that has been sold, a 2nd home, vacation rental, business, ect - I have Etsy commissions available for purchase in my bio.

"Oh, California. My second home. 

When considering February’s Destination of the Month for @4windstravel , my mind immediately went to this beautiful state that I’ve been traveling to since I was 18. My heart breaks for the victims of the Los Angeles wildfires— I watched in horror as the streets I grew up traveling were engulfed in flames. Heartbroken, I was compelled to write a “Love Letter to California” as my next blog post. Click the link in my bio to read how we as the travel community can come together to support the community, and look to the future of California with hope and love.

"I designed this house in Pacific Palisades in the late 80’s and it was completed in 1990. Historic revival was a contemporary topic and I leaned into Streamline Moderne as appropriate for the site and the client. These photos are from just before move-in, I never got a chance to do proper project completion photos.

I recall being fanatical about that tile in the bathroom. There were no cut pieces.

I really didn’t want to be an architect, although I worked hard to do my best to bring good work to my clients. Ultimately, it’s hard to do a good job at something that you just don’t want to do. I’m very proud of this house though and I’ve been thinking about it lately. I’m still in touch with the client, who also bought some of my artwork (pastel landscapes). He’s a lovely person and we get lunch together every couple of years. He’s still got the pastels hanging in his home.

My client sold this house about 10 years ago and it had been remodeled again, the new owners adding a tall garden wall at the line of the garage. It’s a gesture I don’t like—blocking what should be a friendly suburban street from view of the house and letting people know that you’re sequestered inside. But whatever; there’s lots of things I don’t like about architecture and the built environment, and it’s why I took myself out of the business.

The house burned down in the January Palisades fire, and I’m sure a new house will rise there, the land is attractive and incredibly valuable. As I recall you could just see the ocean from a step grade in the back. We planted white rosa rugosa back there, I’m hope they’re still growing.

I've lived in and near Altadena since 1990 so most of my thoughts have been concerning that community. But the Palisades was also a beautiful and special place and my heart goes out to everyone there who lost so much.

"On January 7th, I arrived in Calabasas to an atmosphere thick with smoke and wind—a stark reminder of the conditions I had left just weeks prior after working on the Franklin Fire. I then spent 23 days assigned to the Palisades Fire with CAL FIRE IMT 2, serving as Deputy PIO alongside a team of approximately 100 dedicated Information Officers.

This assignment pushed us to think beyond traditional approaches, adapting to the complexities of an evolving and high-profile incident. I am incredibly proud of everyone who contributed to this response—navigating both the operational and emotional challenges to support the County and City of Los Angeles, as well as the residents and business owners of Malibu, Pacific Palisades, and Santa Monica.

The devastation was unimaginable, yet the resilience of those who lost everything was a powerful testament to the strength and unity of this community. Witnessing that perseverance firsthand was both humbling and inspiring.

To my colleagues and all those involved—thank you for your commitment, adaptability, and unwavering dedication in the face of adversity. #malibu#palisadesfire#calfire#palisades",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGM9bTORgou/,2025-02-18 05:30:42+00:00

"6 weeks ago the unthinkable happened.  In 24 hours I lost everything nearest and dearest to me.  . I thank all of you who reached out with their thoughts, prayers and concerns.  It meant the world to me.    Please forgive me for not responding back.  The  sense of loss is so deep and so painful that it has literally crippled me.  I am not myself.  And just now, I am barely able to even talk about what’s happened without crying.  
I look for glimpses of hope, a “silver lining”, the “reason this has happened to me” that will help me make sense of it all. But it doesn’t come. And 6 weeks later, I am as raw and hurting as I was then.  
 In the early morning hours as I first begin to wake, lying in bed in that “in between place” of sleep and consciousness, I think for a moment, that it’s all been a bad dream...that I’ll wake up and get to go home.  Go back to my friends, my neighbors and the community I loved so deeply.  That life will once again be familiar and safe. anchored in everyday rhythms and routines, and I’ll feel that sense of security and belonging that only familiarity can bring. 
And I believe, in that fleeting moment, that all will be well again.  That I will get to go home.  
. But then I fully wake, and realize nothing will ever be as it once was.  That I won’t be going home.  Everything that I called home, everything that was my life, is no more.  And the ache, and loss and loneliness starts up again.  I get out of bed, knowing I must go on, and promise myself I will do my best to embrace this new reality.  What other choice do I have?  
But still all I want, is to just go home. #palisadesfire #homesweethome #lifechanging #lhomeiswheretheheartis #pacificpalisades #firevictims #pain #loss #ashesoflove #rebuild #godsplan #startingover #palisadesstrong #",1024300882,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGP7KNNRgeB/,2025-02-19 09:08:37+00:00

"Paris Hilton’s $8.5M Malibu beach house was completely destroyed by the Palisades fire. The once-stunning oceanfront estate, known for its breathtaking views and sleek contemporary design, is now nothing but ashes. This home was the perfect embodiment of luxury coastal living—until the wildfire took it all away.

Before its destruction, this modern Malibu retreat featured floor-to-ceiling glass walls and wraparound decks that showcased uninterrupted ocean views. The home’s private gated entry led to a tranquil garden, ideal for yoga or quiet relaxation. Inside, an open-concept living area with stone tile floors and recessed lighting created a seamless indoor-outdoor flow.

The living room, complete with a fireplace, opened to an oceanfront deck, making it the perfect spot for barbecues and al fresco dining. The gourmet kitchen, equipped with top-tier appliances, granite countertops, and custom cabinetry, provided both style and functionality.

Upstairs, the primary suite was a true oceanfront retreat, boasting wood floors, a fireplace, and a spa-like bathroom wrapped in stone tile. Two private oceanfront balconies extended from the suite, featuring a hot tub and space for stargazing. Additional amenities included a den/media room, a beach staircase, an outdoor shower, and a two-car garage.

Now, this once-iconic Malibu home is gone, a tragic reminder of the devastating power of the Palisades fire.

"URGENT: PLEASE SHARE⛑️

 WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME ⌛️

As of today 2/21, the majority of rescue organizations have withdrawn efforts and there are only a handful left with support slowing down. In just a few small Palisades neighborhoods alone, we have 10 cats confirmed to be alive before the storm… and there are countless more out there across these massive burn zones. Just last night WUFAW rescued one of these cats. It takes a lot of patience and effort to go out and re-bait/set new traps daily. With manpower and resources dwindling, our odds are stacking against us.

The rescue organizations are spread thin as is, and understandably they have to shift their focus back to the rest of the SoCal animals that desperately need their help. By next week there may be only a couple organizations out trying to trap and bring these animals home. My mission remains the same. With your help we don’t have to give up on our furry friends.

This was never about money for me. I had no idea how massive this operation was going to become, otherwise I would have asked for support when I first started this mission. Because we’ve reached such a critical point in our efforts, we need to be out there around the clock before we lose our chance at rescuing the remaining survivors. In order for me to continue full time and keep my business closed, I need YOUR support.

Even $5 can make a difference. If you can’t donate, please share the fundraiser link. Every share spreads awareness and helps bring these pets home.

Let’s show these animals that they haven’t been forgotten. Donate link in bio

"That cycling scene gatekeeping? Stops at the door. It doesn’t come in here. 

⚠️ NO DROP, NO RUSH: Road bike beginner’s Ride ⚠️

 March 16, 2025
 Meet at Esquina: 8:00 AM
⏳ Roll Out: 8:30 AM
 25 Miles – Moderate Pace – Social & Training Ride
⚠️ Beginner ride for road bikes (hybrids are ok) 
️ Riding through the city, catch the LA river north, and loop back through NELA 

We know there’s a lot of gatekeeping and ego in the road bike male-driven cycling scene. Too much road bike-shaming, too many people acting like they were never beginners. Not here. This ride is for those who have been pushed away by that culture—for the road cycling-curious, the long-distance hopefuls, those on a health journey, for non-male riders, and anyone looking for a safe, ego-free space to learn and road ride.

Maybe you’re riding a vintage steel bike, a $10k dream build, or something you got secondhand. No matter what you ride, if you’re looking for an open and supportive cycling space, this is your ride.

What to Expect:

✅ No egos. No bike shaming. No dumb questions.
✅ A no-drop pace—everyone stays together.
✅ Seasoned riders to answer questions.
✅ Social ride + space to learn road cycling basics.
✅ Women, POC, non-binary, femme, lgbtq, cyclists encouraged to join.

 Q&A can be asked privately to our seasoned riders or ask out loud! 

 All you need is a road bike, a helmet, and an open mind. Let’s build something together.

Tag a friend who’s been wanting to start cycling and let’s ride!

"Hawaii paintings in their natural habitat.

As many of you know, my daughter Daisy and I lost our home in the Palisades fire last month. We lost all our stuff and all our artwork too. It's just stuff. We are still good. The world is still a beautiful place. But there was a lot of time and care we put into creating all those things that are now gone. It's a little confusing to think about. 

I think of it as an E=MC2 event. (Energy = mass times the speed of light). 

Artists turn creative energy into mass (stuff) paint on a canvas, words on a page, so do the crafts people who made our furniture and clothes and guitars and tile work in our bathroom. All that creative energy was transformed into things - and then the fire transformed it all back into energy again.

Of course you might like to think the things you create live on long after you're gone. Is that just ego? Maybe not. I'm grateful that we can still go see a Da Vinci painting 500 years after he made it, or a 2000 year old wooden statue of Buddha, or the centuries old poems of Emily Dickinson. There's a deep human connection that defies a human lifespan. I am so grateful that those things live on after their creators. I was very grateful I had my grandmothers' paintings as long as I did. But sooner or later, the sun will reclaim it all in a gigantic breath of fire. 

So it makes me wonder, why keep making more stuff? 

The only good answer I can come up with is... because that's what I like to do.

Thanks to everyone for so much love and support during this time. Love is energy that makes more love. Maybe art makes a little love too.

"I wish I could feature them all…

I’ve been reading every comment, every story, every piece of advice since 1/07/25  

And what’s happening here?

It’s more than just support - it’s people opening up, sharing their own losses, their own fires (both literal and internal), and how they found their way through.

It’s inspiring. It’s emotional. 

And it’s helping - more than you know.

Here are just a few from across my social media platforms that really moved me, and I know will impact others too. 

Give yourself the gift to really read them. 

Take note of the ones that resonate. 

Im learning that when we share our experiences, we don’t just heal ourselves- we help someone else find their way too.

And to everyone who has shared, commented, or sent a mindful message - thank you. I see you.

And I appreciate you, deeply.

Drop a comment below -
Something you’ve learned through loss, something from hard times that has helped you, and share this with someone who needs it. ❤️
.

PS. And if we’re not already connected on other social media platforms, let’s change that. Find me on IG, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok - wherever you are @BlakeMallen - and, let’s keep supporting each other on this journey.

"Standing in the ashes of what was once home, I feel like I’ve landed on another planet—unrecognizable, unreal, unfathomable. The air is thick with silence, the ground littered with memories turned to dust. The shattered glass reflects devastation, but it also reflects me—tired, yet carrying on; vulnerable, yet strong; grieving, yet grateful.

Looking into these burned remains feels eerily similar to looking at myself in the mirror these days. That’s me, but also… not me. Who is this version of myself? How did I get here? I know grief. I know loss. I know this will pass, and I will emerge stronger. But I also know it will hurt. And this week, I remembered something important: I am strong enough to sit with that pain, to feel it fully, to let it shape me without breaking me. 

So, I’m not numbing it. Not sugarcoating it. Not distracting from it. I am here, in it— unapologetically, unabashedly. This is me, living through the dystopian chapter of my life while still trying to offer you nuggets of how to respond to life in a mindful way.

These hauntingly beautiful, but tragic photos were taken by my talented friend @jesskoehlerphoto and @krystamasciale who accompanied me the first time I went back to our house in the Palisades. I can't thank you both enough for being there for me as a friend and to document the end of the house. 

Some highlights: one of my Christmas village houses we found intact, the top of my eldest daughter's jewelry box that she had recently given to our little ones, more pieces of the Christmas village and to end we found some clover growing in the ruins, a reminder that life and hope persists and can emerge from the darkest of times. Staying present in the now so that I can witness these moments when they appear.",1024300882,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGTZorDPNI2/,2025-02-20 17:32:38+00:00

"️ Over the past month, I’ve had the honor of working with families who lost their homes in the Los Angeles wildfires, helping them take those first steps toward rebuilding. Now, this effort is expanding as I begin to collaborate with multiple neighbors to rebuild entire streets – creating a stronger, safer, and more sustainable community.

 Rebuilding after a wildfire isn’t just about homes—it’s about restoring lives, neighborhoods, and a sense of belonging.

 For nearly 20 years, I’ve been dedicated to sustainable community development, and over the last three years, I’ve focused on green building and wildfire-resilient home design. California Home Designs is committed to helping families navigate the rebuilding process with cost-effective, fire-resilient, and sustainable design solutions.

❤️‍ I’ve seen firsthand the devastation wildfires leave behind, both personally and professionally. With over 15,000 structures lost in the Eaton and Palisades fires alone, the need for thoughtful, resilient rebuilding has never been greater.

 If you or someone you know is facing this challenge in Altadena or Palisades, I’m here to help.

 Message @californiahomedesigns to start the conversation about rebuilding your home with wildfire resilience in mind.

Amid the hustle and bustle of Frieze Week, your presence and support is appreciated. Come stand with these artists, listen to their experiences, and see the work that has emerged from the ashes.

"Scenes from The Palisades today and I am still in disbelief. Helping my clients with their insurance claims and I realize it’s another  day…another street and I don’t know where I am as I am driving. The landmarks are gone and the views are so drastically different. Unless you witness this type of unthinkable devastation first hand..it is so hard to relate to the loss and trauma. Everyone just wants to go home but there is no home to go to for most. It’s painful and messy. But someday when The Palisades is rebuilt and lively the 2025 Fire Hurricane that destroyed Pacific Palisades will be a story told over and over about the hero’s, the helpers and the resilience of the community. Hoping that day comes sooner than later and that EVERYONE will be OK

"I ran up this street on foot and every house around me was on fire. Propane tanks were exploding, then a bunch of ammo was exploding and it sounded like a shootout was taking place. It was only 4:45pm and the sun was still out, but there was no way to tell since everything was blacked out due to the smoke blocking the sun. At one point the house 100 feet away from me that was burning disappeared in the thick black smoke since the wind shifted. That’s when I decided to head out of the area. I still remember this moment so vividly.

"Reflecting on a Challenging Time

As real estate agents and brokers on the front lines, witnessing the tragic fires in Palisades and Altadena has been one of the hardest challenges of our career to date. The suffering of thousands losing their homes has been heart-wrenching. 

Looking back, the first week of the fires was nothing short of emotional chaos, confusion, and distress. Panic gripped the community as we all faced an unimaginable reality. It forced us to realize just how fortunate we are to have roofs over our heads and sparked a deep sense of gratitude within us. 

In times of crisis, both the good and the bad emerge, reminding us of the importance of kindness and coming together as a community. We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Yahoo News, and MSN for these interviews and allowing us to share our firsthand experiences and perspectives as this tragedy unfolded.  We know many fellow realtors and agents have been moved by similar experiences, and our shared voices and continued collective efforts matter.

As we move forward, it’s time to rebuild and learn from this experience. Let’s remember that giving back and helping those in need always matters and should extend beyond moments of peril and stress; they should be a part of our everyday lives. Together, we can create a stronger, more compassionate community. Lastly and most importantly, a big thank you to all the fire fighters who have risked their lives day in and day out.

"***UPDATE: SOLD***
Thank you all for the many amazing emails and messages. We’re happy to announce the board has sold but will still be on display for tomorrow’s movie. 

Don’t forget to bring your beach chair. 

……….

Longtime friend Gene Cooper / Cooperfish Surfboards (@gcoopa) heard about our fundraiser for Lance Carson (@elcrsn) tomorrow night and brought this gem into the gallery!

GENE IS DONATING 100% OF SALES TO LANCE. 

In 1968, Lance Carson shaped this 10’2” pintail for the one and only John Milius! (The infamous movie director and screen writer for BIG WEDNESDAY!!)

John kept this board 9 years when it ended up with Lance once again. It then went to its second owner who kept it for close to 25 years where Lance once again acquired it back to only land in the hands of Gene Cooper where it’s been for close to the last 10 years. 

This board feels good, looks amazing and Gene says it’s a great rider! (I can only imagine)

We reached out to a couple of Surfboard Auctioneers, collectors and “know it all’s” and they think with the prominence and connections this board carries, it could fetch 20k + at the right surfboard auction. 

Although our ask is no where near that - this board will be on Auction at the gallery through the evening of April 5th. (Unless someone “buys it now”) swing by the gallery, call or DM if you have interest.

"I’ve learned that 2 conflicting things can be true at the same time. 

We can grieve for what is gone...but, we can still be happy and grateful for what is good in our lives too.

Undoubtedly, this last month has been emotionally heavy and difficult for so many. All of us who have friends that have lost their homes have had immense survivor’s guilt, and I’ve mentally struggled and felt weird posting happy and “normal” content.

For this post though, it makes me feel really good that I was able to help my friend find a new home: a place of stability, a safe space to start their healing process. 

I hope that slowly, the sadness of losing the home that had been in their family for generations can turn into a sense of peace and be replaced with happy new memories as they rebuild.

Congratulations to my friend and her family. I’m looking forward to lounging with you in the sun! xo ❤️‍

And then Jesus said, “Jake, @whitroehl , @jonmeaglia , Jonathan, @jarad_leyshon , @breajleyshon , @chaddedmon - I choose you to represent Me in this transformational moment.”

Definitely in the top 10 life honors I’ve ever had bestowed upon me.  Thanks Jesus!!

"Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has dismissed Fire Chief Kristin Crowley following the city’s most devastating wildfire. The Palisades Fire and Altadena Fire left a trail of destruction, with over 18,000 structures affected and nearly 30 lives lost. 

Bass cited mismanagement, lack of a post-fire report, and sending 1,000 firefighters home during the crisis as key reasons for Crowley’s removal. Meanwhile, Crowley blames budget cuts. Who’s responsible for this catastrophe?

"For many of us, Pali isn’t just a school; it’s home. It’s where we’ve spent some of the most formative years of our lives, and it’s where our stories began. Now, more than ever, we need your help to restore the heart of our community and rebuild the place that has been so vital to our growth.

More Than a School – A Home

@palicharterhigh has always been more than a place of learning. It’s a space where we’ve forged lifelong friendships, faced challenges together, celebrated achievements, and created countless memories. Our school grounds are more than just buildings; they are the places where we’ve laughed, cried, learned, and grown. From the classrooms where we’ve discovered our passions to the athletic fields where we’ve competed, this campus is at the core of who we are.

Thank you @palistrong2025 Alessandra & Yasmine & Lily Yadegar for driving this for the Palisades community. ♥️

Please donate to help rebuild Pali Charter High.

"@jeremypadawer is a very prominent figure in the @pokemon hobby, and his life was flipped upside down last month when he got caught in the blaze of the Palisades Fire. When Jeremy left his home he did take 34 cards with him, but he had a problem that was beginning to unfold. 

Unfortunately Jeremy’s home completely burned down, basically leaving nothing left. However, Jeremy also had extremely valuable cards that he left at his local bank…but his bank burned down too. 

In an incredible turn of events, Jeremy was able to recover 10 of his most valuable cards that were left at his bank in his safety deposit box. They were all okay

He mentions “1 Vault survived”, implying maybe there was some other safety deposit boxes that didn’t make it. 

In this video Jeremy shares what survived.

"It’s one thing to see the news images and neighbors’ posts. But there’s nothing like finally being there to fully process it all in person: Our beautiful Will Rogers ranchhouse, stables, and most buildings are truly gone.

The past week the WRRF board toured the ruins with our CA State Parks partners, and the notion of best next steps —even as excavation of treasures from this sad but obvious chapter goes on. Even ruins as familiar as 1930s bathroom heater covers, or Will’s gifted outdoor grill from director pal Hal Roach, were welcome sites amid the gray ashes.

I mean, how many million people since 1944 have come away with Will’s quirky spa “surround shower” as a big memory of their house tour—and now here it is in a whole new, yet intact, light. Minus all that crazy piping, sadly.

But while concepts and goals for a “rebuild” get underway, with local input as well as from Will Rogers World here and around the globe… just know that Will’s ranch *will* return as more than just glorified hiking trails with a famous name attached.

We have the rescued house artifacts, we have a new visitor film underway needing a new home … and we have Will’s spirit and legacy to share. 

We’re not going anywhere. 

In fact… ironically… we also have more people curious and paying attention to everything Will Rogers than we’ve had in years.

So as we move forward into this brave new world of interpreting Will, Betty and their times, we’ll be busier than ever helping fresh minds realize how much Our Will can offer today’s humans hungry for heroes and meaning. Please stay in touch and offer your thoughts as we reach out with the plans, campaigns, and events to come so that this tragedy of history does not erase Will’s legacy and Betty’s gift.

"SAVED: Villa Aurora, home to the man the Nazis called “Enemy Number One of the German People.”

Jewish-German novelist & Hitler critic Lion Feuchtwanger & his wife Marta were in the US on a lecture tour when Hitler rose to power. They never returned home & moved to southern France until they were forced to escape on foot to Spain & eventually landed in LA.

The villa, built in 1928, was purchased by the couple in 1943. It became a gathering place for German intellectuals finding refuge during their exile in paradise. After losing his libraries in Germany & France, Lion amassed 30,000 books here. Upon the pair’s passing, the villa & library were bequeathed to USC.

A Berlin-based non-profit, wanting to honor its history of artistic refuge from the Nazis, purchased it to turn into an artists’ retreat. Since 1995 the villa has hosted 400+ writers, artists, composers & filmmakers, both German & non-Germans facing political persecution in their own countries.

While houses on either side of it burned in the Palisades fire, Villa Aurora miraculously survived.

"Less than 2 months ago,  Los Angeles experienced the worst fires in its history, and today, while walking down San Vicente, I noticed the tulip trees are already in bloom as the vibrant pulse of nature continues unabated. 

Ironically, so many of the people I know who lost everything in the fires are (seemingly) the most accepting of the situation and eager to move forward - far better adjusted than those of us on the periphery who could do little but offer a helping hand where we could to those whose lives were literally burned to the ground.

That also is the vibrant pulse of nature in these resilient people.

"It’s been almost 8 weeks since the fire. I left dazed from anesthesia in my pajamas with my cat and drove to palisades park in Santa Monica thinking I would just relax for an hour or two while they put the fire out. While I was aimlessly walking around I ran into an old friend who had her sweet new baby in tow. It felt symbolic holding her giggly happy little girl in my arms right after finishing my final IVF egg retrieval that morning. It brought tears to my eyes and the feeling of hope washed over me. It was like the universe was telling me “You’re almost there. You’ve got this.” 

And then 5 hours later, our house burned down. I miss my sweet little house but I really miss my neighborhood. It was pure magic. I used to joke that it felt like I was walking around on a movie set because that’s how perfect it felt. I couldn’t wait to be a mom pushing my stroller on our sunset neighborhood walks. And to join the mommy and me groups that all my friends talked about. 

The next few years won’t be as we’d pictured in our head but thats okay . I know that the universe has something even greater planned for all of us who lost our homes in the Palisades (and Malibu/Topanga) and Altadena will come back stronger than before. I’m just so grateful to be alive and healthy and feel so lucky to be surrounded by the best family, friends, and community. Excited for the next chapter of rebuilding our home & building a family .

"Oh, Malibu. Breathtaking, resilient Malibu. Just reminiscing today on one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been on. California holds a special place in my heart and I’ve been devastated seeing the destruction from the fires the past couple months. I can’t imagine how those personally affected are navigating this situation and my heart goes out to them and the first responders who worked tirelessly to keep people and animals safe. 

I was taking a scroll through memory lane in my camera roll and seeing pictures of this gorgeous state had me thinking about how crazy it is that we can capture a moment in time that never changes, even as reality does. We really take for granted how powerful that is.

I had the urge to find a way to contribute however I can, and came across these relief resources that have been giving direct aid. If you feel compelled to donate to those affected, I found that these are some of the best options:

- All Hands and Hearts 
- Save the Children
- Team Rubicon
- American Red Cross 
- Los Angeles County Fire Department Foundation
- Los Angeles United Way 
- Los Angeles County Animal Care Foundation 
- Boys and Girls Club of Malibu

"THE JOURNAL: State Farm Cut Policies. Then the Fires Hit. 

“In recent years, most home insurers were fleeing areas of California with high risk for wildfires. But State Farm was there, dominating the market. Then, just months before the devastating L.A. fires, the company dropped 30,000 homeowners from their books. WSJ’s Jean Eaglesham explains how the risk that State Farm unloaded is now a problem for the rest of California.”

An insightful dive into the CA devastation post wildfires. I didn’t think it could get worse— it can & has.

" Sign the Letter! We at Resilient Palisades are advocating for a secure, affordable, fast, and fully electric rebuild of LA after the fires. Mayor Bass has paused the all-electric construction rule, and we need to say NO! Let’s rebuild LA S.A.F.E.

 https://rebuildlasafe.org

Rebuilding with all-electric systems is crucial for several reasons. In the event of an earthquake, gas lines can rupture, leading to dangerous explosions and fires. This risk is heightened during wildfires, where gas infrastructure can ignite and exacerbate the devastation, as we have tragically witnessed. 

Furthermore, maintaining gas lines complicates efforts to put power lines underground, a key strategy for reducing wildfire risks. When gas lines are present, it becomes more difficult and costly to install underground power infrastructure, leaving communities vulnerable to outages and hazards. Transitioning to electric systems not only enhances safety but also supports a sustainable future.

"Why you need a post fire appraisal. The purpose of a post-fire real estate appraisal is to determine the exact pre and post-fire values of your property so you can make informed decisions. These values are needed for a variety of reasons. The reasons range from investment decisions, calculating an IRS casualty loss for your taxes, negotiating with your insurance adjuster, property tax appeal and evidence for a lawsuit. Below are just a few more reasons why you need a post-fire appraisal

Investment decisions to sell or rebuild
Pre listing market analysis
IRS casualty loss
Insurance settlement
Evidence for lawsuit
Property tax appeal
Short pay mortgage

The process begins with a physical inspection of the property to determine fire damage, specific location in the neighborhood and the view from the site. Some properties may only have interior smoke/ash damage, exterior soot staining, damage from heat while others are totally destroyed. Some damage can be remediated while other properties must be completely rebuilt.

SOLD!

$3,400,000

Blessed to have helped my clients secure a new place to call home after the tragic #PalisadesFire. Their trust in me during such a critical time means everything. I did not take it lightly & I was there for them every step of the way. 

Originally listed at $3,700,000, I was able to negotiate $300,000 off, closing at $3,400,000! This escrow was no easy feat—multiple counters, intense negotiations, but in the end, both sides walked away happy.

"This is one of the hardest seasons of our lives for many of us - and trying to process what’s happened, while also figuring out what comes next can feel very heavy at times. 

But here’s what I’m realizing: we don’t have to figure it out alone.

When you go through something like this, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.

To not know where to start. To struggle to see the big picture.

But this community is so full of wisdom, experience, and people who are taking action. I am reminded of this more and more each day. 

The conversations we’re having matter. 

And the ideas being shared have the power to create real change.

So thank you - to everyone who’s contributed, offered insight, and kept this conversation alive. 

Your voice is important.

Let’s keep it going. Share this post. 

Let’s make sure these solutions reach the right ears.

Let’s rebuild something better - together.

"HSC&A / Out of the Ashes: Artist Talk Recap

On Saturday, we had the privilege of listening to the artists of Out of the Ashes as they shared their experiences of loss, resilience, and the long road ahead after the devastating Eaton and Palisades Fires.

The room was full—full of grief, full of hope, full of artists who have lost lifetimes of work. Some lost their homes, their studios, their archives—everything they had built. 40 artists, 40 stories. Not every artist had the chance to speak, but hands were raised solemnly throughout the audience signaling that their work is on display. The artists who spoke with Hannah offered deeply personal stories, recalling moments of profound devastation, and reflections on their identity as artists in the wake of unimaginable loss.

The feeling in the room was unlike anything we’ve experienced before—an intense catharsis, a shared mourning, a collective attempt to process the unthinkable. 

It was a moment of deep connection in a week filled with high-energy openings and dazzling exhibitions across the city. In the midst of LA Art Week, this was a stopping point. A space for reflection. A moment that will stay with us forever.

Thank you to Craig Krull and Douglas Marshall for curating such a powerful, sensitive exhibition and for giving these artists a place to process, express, and find support in one another.

Most of all, thank you to the artists who bravely shared their stories—we are in awe of your strength.

We know there are many GoFundMe accounts helping Malibu area, businesses and residents affected by the fire. The property of the Bungalows is a Malibu landmark- We and they would appreciate  your support. 

A link to their GoFundMe page is on our profile.

Repost: Lynn Bealer, owner of The Malibu Bungalows, is one of the most kind, compassionate and overwhelmingly generous people I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with. She has spent her life creating non profit organizations and doing missions and helping others for decades before she created the The Malibu Bungalows. My opportunity as a floral designer came from her, and my joy of being at the Bungalows comes from the vision and passion she’s put into it. I am forever grateful for her, and for the great women I’ve been able to collaborate with at this wonderful place…filled with art, love and creativity and surrounded by all of nature’s splendor. It is our precious little gem on the PCH and we need to keep it going in the wake of the tragic fire and recent mudslide. With your help, we will be able to open our doors and get the businesses functioning again, despite all that’s happened. 
Thank you & God Bless you all! ☀️

" Landing on Sandpaper: The Reality of Resilience in Challenging Times  

Ever felt like life keeps throwing resistance at you, no matter which way you turn? Every step forward feels like dragging your feet across rough, unforgiving sandpaper? That’s exactly where I’ve been for the last six weeks 

I lost my home. I lost my office. The #PalisadesFire took more than just physical spaces—it took my stability. And ever since, every move is filled with friction. 

But here’s what I’ve learned: Resilience does not mean to avoid discomfort—rather it means understanding that sometimes, the only way through is to sit in it. 

 What if instead of fighting resistance, you learned how to move with it? 

That’s what I’ll be sharing in Unleash Your Inner Architect: Building a Business That Resonates with Your Soul—a live webinar on how to stop chasing and start attracting. It’s time to shift from forcing to flowing and build a business aligned with who you really are. 

 Ready to find your way forward? Comment ""UNLEASH"" below and let’s do this together. Because even when you’re landing on sandpaper, there’s always a way forward.

Two lots, some of the first to be, cleared in the Alphabets. Essentially simultaneously. The one with the ACoE sign, done by the Army Corps at no cost to the owner; in addition to the grooming, includes a layer of bio-mulch which should sprout into grass to keep the soil together.
The one on the right with the green & black sign, done by a private contractor at a cost to the owner or at least to their insurance, is “cleared”.

"Patches of grass sprout after rains in Pacific Palisades, CA Monday February 24th looking down near Albright St westward towards the Pacific Ocean. I hadn’t been back into this historic part of town since the third day of the fire, as downed trees and powerlines made it hazardous to navigate. Today, construction crews were starting to scrape some homesites of debris, while crews worked to mitigate hazmat at other homes. It was unclear if it was private or Army Corps of Engineers working. The scale of the destruction is still shocking 6 weeks later, as is the silence. 

I also spent time on PCH in Malibu, where ash was covered in mudflows last week, now baked and cracked in the sun. I’ll share images of that scene tomorrow. 

Safety note: Now that TFR’s are lifted in the Palisades Fire burn area, I put the UAS up for a short flight in Class G airspace, and also got FAA LAANC approval, since this part of Pacific Palisades is right on the edge of Class B Airspace for LAX. #PalisadesFire - SP",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGe7U76xJ2Q/,2025-02-25 04:58:41+00:00

Nature is Healing – Let’s Give It Time
We know you’re eager to get back on the trails, and we are working hard to make that happen! But burn areas need time to recover. Rushing in too soon can damage fragile regrowth, disrupt wildlife, and slow nature’s renewal process.
The good news? Fire isn’t just destruction—it’s also transformation. Some plants, called fire followers, thrive in the wake of wildfires, blooming in vibrant displays thanks to rich soil. 
Until the trails are safe to re-open, enjoy these photos of nature’s incredible recovery! Your patience helps protect these landscapes for years to come.

"Why you need a post-fire appraisal if your home has been damaged or destroyed in the recent fires. The purpose of a post-fire real estate appraisal is to determine the exact pre and post-fire values of your property so you can make informed decisions. These values are needed for a variety of reasons. The reasons range from investment decisions, calculating an IRS casualty loss for your taxes, negotiating with your insurance adjuster, property tax appeal and evidence for a lawsuit. Below are just a few more reasons why you need a post-fire appraisal

* Investment decisions to sell or rebuild 
* Pre listing market analysis
* IRS casualty loss
* Insurance settlement
* Evidence for lawsuit
* Property tax appeal
* Short pay mortgage
* Buy out family member

The process begins with a physical inspection of the property to determine fire damage, specific location in the neighborhood and the view from the site. Some properties may only have interior smoke/ash damage, exterior soot staining, damage from heat while others are totally destroyed. Some damage can be remediated while other properties must be completely rebuilt. Prices start at $450 for an average sized home for pre-fire and post-fire values.

"I finally went on my first hike since the fire. 

The difference in landscape between the north and south showed the stark contrast between the Santa Monica Mountains before and after the fire. 

What is normally vibrant, bountiful and many shades of green was now a barren, brown earth. 

Needless to say, it’s an emotional time - there’s so much going on for everyone - but all I know is that I feel better when I keep putting one foot in front of the other (literally and figuratively).

Whatever you’re going through today, I’m sending you love and patience. 

We can keep going, even when it’s hard.

"Certified & Ready! ✅ I’m officially Wildfire Defense Certified through USGBC-CA and CALFIRE!  The Wildfire Defense Certificate Training Program is all about building resilience—helping homes and landscapes better withstand wildfires through strategic design, firewise materials, and smart maintenance practices.

With wildfires becoming more frequent and intense, fire resilience is essential in home design. I’m excited to apply this expertise to help communities build stronger, safer, and more sustainable homes. A huge thank you to @usgbcca and @calfire for offering such a valuable program!

"The surf around Las Tunas Beach in Malibu takes on the color of runoff from the Santa Monica Mountains after winter storms battered the coast, impacting marine life and leading to closure of beaches. A Malibu resident reported to me yesterday they found a dead sea lion along the beach (they sent me a photo), and local marine mammal rescue groups told me they are seeing sick animals on the beaches. I am researching the cause and effect, but it appears the runoff from wildfires, which include Benzene and heavy metals such as lead, are impacting our sensitive coasts. 

In this aerial image, you can see how these homes have absolutely zero barriers in place to prevent their contents from spilling out into the tidal zone and washing out to sea. Depending on the exact orientation of the beach, and local surf, many of the beaches were coated in a muddy runoff sludge. I understand the concerns about waste cleanup locations, but leaving things open like this is far worse than containing items in barrels with liners. Toxic waste is getting into food chain and affecting our water supply. 

However, many of these homes were already remediated by the EPA, with unstable items such as lithium batteries, propane containers, and Asbestos removed. But, there are still thousands of tons of inorganic materials washing into the ocean. I’ll give credit to Carbon Beach, where many burned homes had a temporary barrier installed to prevent toxic runoff into the Pacific. The sand/shore was demonstrably cleaner in aerial images there (4th image). 

Safety note: Flight conducted in Class G airspace, no TFR in place, over public property (state beach, state right of way, and ocean). No flying is conducted over people, moving vehicles, or private property airspace (effectively about 100 feet above private property). - SP #PalisadesFire",694608544,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGgjmjVT7BX/,2025-02-25 20:09:51+00:00

"In the wake of the devastating Palisades wildfires, Derek and Cami Capps, the owners of Palisades Studio Performing Arts & Fitness, lost everything—both their home and dance studio. Out of the 100 families who were apart of this studio, 98 of them are displaced and have lost their homes, schools, and beloved dance studio. 

But even in the face of such overwhelming loss, Derek and Cami have shown incredible strength. Thanks to the kindness of the Abby Lee Dance Studio, they’ve found a temporary location at 11316 Santa Monica Blvd., where they’ve started offering dance classes to existing and new students! 

For many of these kids, dance is not just a class—it’s a healing space that helps them find hope, joy, and a connection to the Palisades community once again. 

This small business, like so many others, needs the community’s support now more than ever. You can help by visiting their website, signing up for classes, and donating to their GoFundMe to ensure they can continue teaching and uplifting children and families in need.

Let’s come together to help rebuild what was lost, one step at a time.

"Missing our HOME ❤️‍

It’s so hard to explain what this experience has been like. We are very happy and grateful to be living in Santa Barbara now but this entire situation is more heartbreaking and emotionally exhausting than anyone can ever explain. 

To put it in perspective, for those who are rebuilding their homes, they are being quoted 3-5 years  If your child is 7 (like my daughter and our friends kids) 5 years is the rest of their childhood. That’s it. You don’t get to grow up in #PacificPalisades 

One day you wake up and your entire life that you built from nothing is gone.  

It isn’t just losing a home or a community, it’s the death of a life and a dream and an entire path. It’s a deep deadening heartbreak on every level. 

BUT it’s also a rebirth. ️ 

A chance at a new and potentially better life. 

More than anything it’s a reminder that life is precious and fragile and nothing is promised. Every day we get to be alive is a gift. ✨

When I am sad or overwhelmed I try to focus on the silver linings of this crazy experience. 

I’ve found that making a list of all the positives has helped me a lot. If you’re struggling in your own life, try making a list of what has come out of your current situation that you are grateful for. ✔️

Here’s mine.  Because of the #PalisadesFire:

• I got to move back to Santa Barbara (my fave town!) 
• My daughter gets to go to a new, wonderful school she loves and is much happier in SB 
• We are spending more time outside in nature, hiking, walking, riding bikes, going to the beach ️ 
• I have adopted a less is more mentality and I’m embracing a minimalist life 
• I get to reconnect with my friends in SB 
• I now live 10 minutes from Rincon (my fave surf break!)‍♀️ 
• We now live closer to our family on the Central Coast ‍‍‍
• We have bunnies that live on our front lawn  

What are some things you are grateful for? Please share some positivity and love. ✨

"It’s been over a month since the LA fires, and the impact is still deeply felt in our community. Many are grappling with loss and uncertainty, while the world around us seems to move on. 

 Grief is a process, and it’s important to honor the feelings that come with it reminding ourselves that it’s okay to not be okay. It can also feel incredibly isolating and grief is invisible. 

I had a beautiful conversation with someone who lost everything in the #palisadesfire and reminded me how our Los Angeles community can begin to heal if everyone helps one person right now. We don’t need to solve all the suffering in the world but think of what would happen if we help one person? 

If you need a community to heal with, I have been spending a lot of time meditating on @heartmathinstitute’s Global Consciousness App. We heal in community and love is our greatest source of healing. 

I leave you with a challenge, what is a small act of #kindness you can show someone today?

"Everyday driving down PCH my favorite memory was these Lifeguard Towers passing the Castellammare Bridge in the Palisades and passing by the Reel Inn Restaurant daily Puns of the day, my favorite Thai restaurant Cholada at Topanga Beach, and the 2 Malibu Signs.  Sunset Mesa was the neighborhood I grew up in my whole life and where my parents lived for 40 years. We lost our home in the palisades fire also but Hopefully we all can rebuild and the Palisades and Malibu go back to the special place we all have good memories from. 
Luckily my parents were able to grab some boxes of childhood photos while evacuating. I was at work in Malibu when the fire started but wasn’t able to get any of my personal things. Lost a good amount of clothing, a lifelong sneaker collection and personal sentimental items that probably won’t be able to be replaced.

I have always wanted to resell stuff online ever since I was a kid, started reselling stuff on eBay and started selling sneakers.  I have used this Malibu Mart social media accounts and my website Malibu Mart .com more of a blog promoting other people’s brands and stores but am hoping to one day create a actual online business but just been using it as a hobby to just repost and share random stuff.

I’m grateful to have had people donate some clothing to get us back on our feet  and all the organizations that stepped up to offer free basic necessities and support

"How important is ""home""? There's no quantifying it. My painting subjects in the last ten years have basically consisted of ""Home"" and ""Afar"". 

So when I recently saw the massive destruction of homes in my childhood town of Pacific Palisades, I felt possessed by the idea of giving some of these vanished houses a second life on canvas. I was so very lucky to find @ashley_miller__ and @amybeemerlev, two visionary women who organized a database of homes, their former owners, and artists who had the same impulse that I did. They are @homesinmemoriam on Instagram.

A Los Angeles Times reporter, Jessie Schiewe @jessiewritesgood found us and sent the amazing photographer @emilravelo to take pictures. 

I hope to do many more paintings of homes. Each one has a soul, and something to say.",212999109,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGmAqbESW1D/,2025-02-27 22:59:59+00:00
"Pacific Palisades toward Santa Monica 

1️⃣ Something about this view just feels like home—the golden light, the endless ocean, the palm trees lining PCH. I’ve taken so many photos along this coast over the years, but this one might be my favorite ✨ #californiadreaming

2️⃣ Sometimes doing mundane things at home is as amazing as being on vacation ☀️ #hometownappreciation

"Retail Therapy: I am lucky. I lost my house in the Palisades fire, but I have my family, my dogs, and many of my valuables. My husband, a very cautious and way-too-logical being, told me to think like the house was burning down. I rolled my eyes, took his advice, and packed the car (I have a Chevy Tahoe) to the brim, thinking about how painful it was going to be to unpack my type-B mountains of boxes and bags of photos and heirlooms in a couple days when we were allowed home. Needless to say, I hardly packed any clothes. I had one clean laundry basket from winter vacation I hadn’t gotten around to sorting yet. And it was a mix of both my and my kids’ stuff ‍♀️ I threw it in the front seat. After all, I could replace “the material things.” Anywho, the house burned down around 7 PM that night and in a Macallan 12 haze, I sobbed with my family, realizing that our community we had worked so hard to be part of was melting away.  Now, I’m not going to lie, the sadness surrounding the loss of my wardrobe hit me pretty early on. As a stylist and clothing lover, I spent many a childless hour curating a wardrobe that expressed who I was. It was my art, my outlet and a source of comfort, and it was gone; even the 20-year-old sweats I threw on during sick days to bring me some relief. That was a hard moment and one of intense regret. My Jackie-O Gucci purse I couldn’t afford but bought anyway with my parents’ credit card while studying abroad was lost too.  It was a beautiful symbol of my irresponsible youth. So now, how to pick up the pieces? Even for me it’s a daunting task because it’s less about shopping and more about reclaiming “me.” The generously donated alo sweatsuits are cute and comfy, but not something I would buy. Therefore, we’re swapping building a styling business for offering gentle guidance on how to make a new closet “so you” once again! Please also feel free to comment or DM with any questions or requests, and we’ll address in upcoming posts #palisadesfire #onestepatatime #rebuildingmyself #retailtherapy #givingback",213387672,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGoQQBvSN7m/,2025-02-28 19:54:41+00:00

Rose garden, vegetable garden, new pool area and hang out area for her kids. The fire started and blew up everything so quickly. I called at 3:30 and she said the fire is on our street .. we have to go! I called her the next morning to learn everything was destroyed. The true gardenista in her said, “the only thing left is the boxwood” Sending courage and healing strength while navigating the future ❤️‍

"My elderly auntie and uncle are amongst the thousands of families who lost everything in the catastrophic LA wildfires during January 2025. Their son Nima (my cousin) has just launched their GoFundMe. 

We know so many are in need. And so many of you have already donated to others so please know that even sharing this fundraiser means the world to us. (Seriously.)

Their home is where we had many family get-togethers celebrating holidays, gathering around in times of need, or just hanging out to catch up on life. 

Like all others displaced by the wildfires, all their belongings turned to ash. We are still processing this tidal wave of shock and grief. 

The rest of us have the privilege and fortune to return to our own homes and absorb this turn of events. 

Shirin and Hossein, in their golden years, have had that peace taken away in brutal fashion. 

That fog of shock is only now dissipating and this new reality is setting in, harsh as it is. 

That 3rd pic is of them in the kitchen that my uncle built for them. ❤️‍

Truly any amount makes a **direct** impact in helping them rebuild. Thank you for caring and taking the time to read their story in the GoFundMe. ❤️

"Everything is gone. The homes they had, the streets they knew, the lives they built. Everything.

 But here and there, little things remain—a hoop with no basketball, a swing with no child to laugh on it, a washing machine with no laundry to clean, chairs with no one to sit, an elevator with no place to go.

All that remains are ghosts of a life that existed before the fire.

Proof that they were here.

"A January transfer to foster to adoption story that warmed our hearts.

Agoura was the designated small animal evacuation center when the fires began.  We had to quickly get creative to clear cages fast when we were down to 2 cages early in the outbreak of the fires. 

Our Carson Animal Care Center graciously agreed to transfer in 8 Agoura pups to help us out.

Hank #A5663634 was one of the pups transferred to Carson to make cage space room for an increasing number of incoming fire evacuee pups. We said good bye to our boy telling him he’d be back to Agoura soon.

Unbeknownst to us it was about to be his lucky day (& soon to be his lucky future!) when an absolutely lovely foster family near our Carson Care Center stepped up to take him into their home! It was immediate love for our boy with his foster Mama & sibs reporting: “he is such a gentleman, so loving with my young girls.” They kept telling us what a great dog he is, a gentle giant, and we who were already crazy in love with Hank whole heartedly agreed!

Then as the foster family & all of us had fallen in love with Hank so too did the girl’s homeschool teacher! He decided to adopt and they all drove to Agoura from the Carson area to make it official!

Happily Hank is living with his new family very close to his fosters so they can visit him whenever they need more of Hank’s special brand of canine love!

Thank you to Hank’s foster family who stepped up to give Hank a temporary home.

Thank you to Hank’s new family who have given him a forever, loving home.
#fromfostertoforever

We are so grateful to both of these families!

"@beechstreetcafe - a beloved Italian dining staple in Pacific Palisades since 2005, has been devastated—but their story goes beyond just the loss of a restaurant.

After the fires, the owner and his son didn’t evacuate. Instead, they stayed behind, fighting flames for over 40 hours, helping to save countless homes—even as their own livelihood was reduced to ashes. Most will never know how these local heroes risked everything for their neighbors.

Now, it’s our turn to step up. 100% of the GoFundMe donations will go to Beech Street’s staff and to help rebuild them—the people who made this community hub feel like home for over 20 years. Any amount helps, and if you can’t donate, please share or support other local causes helping our community rebuild.

"January adoptions part 2… by the second & third week of the fires the kennels were mostly filled with fire evacuees whose families needed safe refuge for their animals. 
And though we didn’t have many available animals thankfully adopters continued to come to the Care Center and as each fur face found a home we gained another open cage.

Neela has a new family who are savvy to the needs of an active cattle dog! 
Pupdate from her new Dad:
“Here’s some photos of our hikes and some chillin in the office! We’re still nailing down eating but it’s not bad, sleep is good tho! We are doing great!

Ozzie was adopted to a family with an adorable 4 year old girl. Mom was a vet tech assistant in the past & knows how to work with a shy pup. During the intro he took treats from everybody, we think he knew they were the family for him!

Alma Hitchcock #A5672770
had a perfect meet & greet with her new Mom. Alma will have a cat sib who Mom will slowly introduce the new family member to.

Marlon #A5662216 met his new dad who instantly fell in love with our boy! He works at a local pet boarding facility and plans on taking Marlon with him to work. Lucky Marlon!

Marbles #А5664682 visited the board of supervisors meeting as the featured BOS shelter pet and found a home on the spot!

Binks #A5650817 our sassy bun, one of our long timers was pulled by Rusty’s Rescue who came up from Menefee to Agoura to see what they could do to help during the fires and cleared a much needed cage in our cat & bunny building!#resucebunny 

Mimi #A5671783 was adopted by a very kitten savvy couple. Her Papa took photos of her Mama Tootsie so he could show Mimi pictures of her for comfort.

Mama Tootsie has a new family!

Sweet senior Jack #А5666542 is home sweet home!

Piggies Wynn #A5662374, Cappuccino #A5652644, & Oreo #A5652643 went into foster care when Volunteer Lisa answered the emergency foster plea to help clear cages during the fires. Foster fail! #fosterfail

Thank you to Rusty’s Rescue & our adopters for their support, happy lives to all our formerly homeless fur babies!!!",5619612,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGrMOomSFJW/,2025-03-01 23:17:15+00:00

"We’re kicking things off with Critical Masa—because we ride to eat! Then, we’re rolling into our No Drop No Rush Beginner Road Ride, the perfect space for new cyclists to build confidence on the road.

Mid-month, we slow down to reflect with the Closing Ceremony of Expressions: A Prison Art Experience, an evening of powerful storytelling through art.

For those looking for deeper conversations, our Healing Masculinity Men’s Circle offers a space to share, grow, and support one another.

And finally, we close out the month with the Boyle Heights Chamber of Commerce Mixer, bringing together local businesses and community leaders.

Join us as we ride, celebrate, and strengthen our community together. See you at Esquina! ✨

"The loss of a single home is not just the loss of the structure or its contents. It’s the loss of security, of memories, of community for the people who lived there and for the people who visited. It’s the loss of traditions and keepsakes.

The loss of one home is the loss of an entire world.

Approximately 5500 homes were lost in the Palisades in January, in an area larger than the size of Manhattan.

Approximately 9000 homes were lost in Altadena.

Every single one of them was a whole world.

"Mariposa and Olive

This is one of the last if not the very last surviving wood A-Frame house in Altadena that looks exactly how it did when it was built in 1924 by famous author, Kyle Onstott. Kyle was also a competition dog trainer. Prior to the construction of these houses the lot was used as his dog kennel. Outside of the four house houses subdivided on his lot, nearly every other house in the area was destroyed. This house is significant because it sits dead center in the historically Black area of Altadena and represents what many of the houses looked like at its peak.

"Birds of a Feather  
A shoutout to my Teenager who is an absolute legend. 
As are a couple of her friends who also lost their homes in the Palisades Fire and are also dancing in this show. I am completely mind blown by the strength of these girls. Their grit, their perseverance, their devotion to their schoolmates and dance partners, even amidst losing absolutely everything that they knew and that held them safely.

She doesn’t like me posting her on social media which is why you don’t see her here much. But I am taking this moment because she has her four school Dance Performances this weekend and my Mama heart is so proud. 
Since the loss of our home, we have moved 30 miles North of the city which means she now takes an hour school bus ride each way. She shows up for her Dance classes both in and out of school and has many late nights and early mornings. 
I am in awe of her perseverance. It gut punches me every few days, that this will be a part of my children’s’ life story. She will move through her life saying “when I was 13 years old our home, street, entire town burned down. We lost everything material”. It’s hard to wrap my head around it. And as a Mom, I cannot do anything to fix that. I can’t take us back. I can’t fix this. I can only usher us forward with as much grace, ease, trust and faith possible. 

She has never been a child that is attached to “stuff”. Really the only thing she misses is her teddy bear that she has had since birth. She of course misses the space of her room, being near the ocean. But has been so flexible with it all. 
Anyway, watching these 137 girls perform last night, I was so moved by their energy. The way they show up. It is a testament. A testament that our kids are strong. Especially when we are strong. 
Sometimes “that which doesn’t kill us, makes us stronger” is true. 
Lead with strength. Take care of yourself deeply Mamas, in your mind, your body, your connection with your soul and Spiritual connection. It really matters. 
Our kids are incredible. Make sure to tell them. Often. Lift them up️

"Checking in after a bit of a hiatus. January 2025 was one of the toughest months of my life. Our house in Pacific Palisades, our first after saving for years, and all our possessions were destroyed in the Palisades Fire.

Things are better - we’ve settled in Santa Monica and are starting to rebuild our lives. Our lot was cleared by the Army Corps of Engineers last week, in one of the first batches to be completed in the Palisades.

This is not the end of challenges, but instead the start of a journey. I don’t know what the next 3, 6, 12 months will hold as we figure out what our next steps are. I do know that I’m celebrating the bright spots when I can and taking on the problems one at a time.

RIP Sunset, you will rise again.

"I see you❤️ with your ashes, and uncertainty,

Questionable debris removal with black gunk washing up on your beaches,

With your people unable to live in their homes because they were destroyed,

Or are now toxic,

Kids, dentists, midwives, teachers, mamas,

Sitting in hours of traffic a day 

To get to work, or school, or dance class..

Because of road closures or a temporary home.

Everyone in shock nearly 2 months later,

Whether aware of it or not,

From the nights our city burned.

Grief like rain,

And hope like the rising sun.☀️

I see it all.

And I see this:

Glorious Pacific   Ocean who keeps calling us back home,

Whispering, “remember that which is unchanging,

Which is silent and eternal.

This is how you prevail.”

"I keep having this recurring dream of all the things I would have grabbed, had I had more time and more clarity of thought.
***************************
I would have grabbed my daughter’s Snow White dress. The one she wore everyday-red ribbon head band and flannel heart-shaped pocket book.
*********************
I would have pulled down plastic bins that were filled to the point of buckling—stuffed with baby blankets, knit hats with oversized flowers, and a favorite pink polka dot dress. The wide brim pink sun hat! And the pink pearled gloves she found in my grandmothers jewelry box. I would have gale-force blown through the closet to find the Audrey like ensemble she fashioned for herself for kindergarten open house. 
********************
Each time breathing in all the scents of childhood as I fall meltingly into memories—I never want to lose. 
*************************
I would have grabbed the unframed photo of my great Aunt Helen and Uncle Bill—their romance on display with matching tennis outfits and feisty wooden rackets.  It sat for years against my blue foral coffee mug used as a holder for my collection of purple pens. I have no idea why I never framed it. I think I felt they wanted to be free and spontaneous. Unencumbered by boundaries. More on them soon. Miss that photo everyday.
*******************
If I had more time and was not so focused on listening to the scratch ‘n fizz frequency of our emergency radio- waiting to hear if the roads were clear and we could evacuate safely.  Or if I had the head space to grab my Grandmother’s silver candle holders, family Seder plate and Havdalah set we used on our wedding—for holidays and sabbath.  If only I hadn’t answered the door for the twenty-seventh time to calm the anxious neighbor-single mom-two kids. Or worry about the young babysitter making sure she wasn’t alone. 
*******************
In my dream I’m always running. Scooping up sea shells, or putting the tiny photo of Grandpa Joel in my pocket. Finding his saxophone. 
***************
Would I have lined my entry with baskets and bins filled from corner to crevice? The answer—probably not. 
**********************
But in my dreams, I do.

We believe that the towering trees that once provided shelter and beauty are vital to the recovery of our homes and the neighborhood’s identity. As the Army Corps of Engineers tags trees for removal, local arborists and passionate advocates are fighting to preserve the healthy ones that survived the flames, echoing the sentiments of homeowners like Seriina Covarrubias in Altadena. We understand that these trees do more than just beautify the landscape; they are symbols of resilience and life, standing guard over the memories and legacies of those who lost so much. We must raise our voices to ensure that the Palisades’ leafy giants are given a chance to heal and thrive once more.

"So many of you asked, “is my garden/orchard safe post fires???,” that I turned to research and finding so little, then Honey Guy (my real life partner and an archaeologist), and we partnered with Duke University, for a post-fires soil study with urban and fires soil specialist, Dr. Daniel Richter. 

We have well over 100 and the list is still growing!

What have we learned so far? We’ll publish preliminary data very soon, but here’s the answer to the question above from our soil scientist:
 
“Every home should know it’s lead number.” 
TEST!! 
Lead is an indicator for a host of other contaminants.
Your soil science doesn’t lie. 
If not safe… call a professional in.

Burn zone: test and retest after ALL of your neighbors scrape (they’ll dust you, and 1/3 come up above EPA warning levels post scrape for this reason). 

IF your soil tests in multiple locations are well below EPA warning levels, do you need to grow anything or remediate your soil? 
No.

Should you add biochar and other amendments?
We do, but organic compost is truly the queen of all remediation and soil health.
Note: We tested every single California available soil and compost in our commercial greenhouse, and one out of all of them repeatedly produced plants that were so much taller and healthier than every other, we no longer had to even look at the tags: @malibucompost @number2organics
You can find it  @aquaflosupply 
Neither of them asked nor paid me a cent to say this.

Where can you test?
Comment “Soil Test” and I’ll message you a list! 

Non-burn #EatonFire #Altadena or #PalisadesFire site that wants to be part of a soil study? Comment, “non-burned.” And I’ll send you the signup link!

Burned site that wants to be part of our soil study and citizen science? (Note, we don’t want 10 neighbors, good data is peppered from a broader area), comment, “❤️‍” and I’ll private message you.

"Once an untouched paradise and home to the Chumash people for millennia, Malibu’s modern story is one of exclusivity, ambition, and the allure of Hollywood glamour.
 
In the late 1800s, wealthy landowners Frederick and May Rindge fought to keep Malibu private, building a Victorian ranch and blocking access with guards. After Frederick’s death in 1905, May faced financial troubles and eventually leased land to Hollywood’s A-list.
 
By 1926, the Malibu Movie Colony had been established, attracting silent film stars like Clara Bow and Gloria Swanson with oceanfront lots leased for just $1 per foot per month. Stars built cozy beach cottages where they hosted Prohibition-era parties and learned to surf from Duke Kahanamoku. However, nature struck back when a fire in 1929 destroyed nearly 30 homes. As Hollywood transitioned from silent films to talkies, new stars like Jack Warner and Bing Crosby built grand homes, transforming the Colony from a bohemian retreat into an elite enclave.
 
Malibu faced significant fire challenges in the 21st century, including the Franklin Fire in December 2024 and the severe Palisades Fire in January 2025. Despite the destruction, the community’s spirit remains strong. As debris removal and rebuilding efforts continue, Malibu shows strong unity and determination to restore the coastal haven that residents and visitors cherish.

"Palisades Fire

From 2022 to 2024, the mountains around LA changed rapidly: years of drought gave way to record rainfall, fueling a surge of new growth.
But this brief recovery carried its own risks. As temperatures climbed, the dense vegetation withered, turning the landscape into dry, volatile fuel. Fire season is no longer a predictable window, it’s an expanding, intensifying reality.

The 2025 wildfires didn’t just burn, they moved. Fueled by dry vegetation and driven by ferocious Santa Ana winds, the flames spread through the LA mountains with unprecedented speed. This was not just another bad fire season, it is the beginning of a new era of unpredictability. Read more in our latest piece. Link in bio.

"Two Months In…
.
At each anniversary of the devastation (devaversary?), I like to take a moment and see how things have changed. This time there’s a MAJOR difference. Amongst all obligations that were thrown our way on Jan 7, one of the biggest was finding a new place to live. Well, I’m happy to say, we are no longer nomadic. We finally have a new “home”.
.
I will eternally have love and appreciation for the angels that gave us a place to stay during this difficult time. But after a while living in places that aren’t yours, with stuff that isn’t yours, has an effect on your psyche. It makes you miss your own destroyed home even more. So it was monumental to finally locate a new “home”. But as soon as Paulo and I entered this place, held the keys, and had a first meal, a new reality set in… uh, it’s empty, and we have NOTHING to fill it with. We need, well, everything. That’s when we again felt the absolute love and charity of mankind.
.
When we were back in Utah, we had so many friends and family help us locate furniture to start filling our new “home”. I could write pages about this alone, because it brings me to tears, but donations were found to help us get a huge head start. Still a long way to go, but Utah showed UP. Then they loaded it all in a trailer, and Amy’s sister and brother-in-law drove it here to us. Then another incredible army of friends helped us unload and set it up. Our new “home” was born.
.
I can’t tell you how overwhelmed I’ve been at every step of this experience. It’s humbling beyond words. But if I’m completely honest, the emotions are still complex. I still feel weird. I still feel displaced. I still feel like I’m in a place that isn’t mine, surrounded by stuff that isn’t ours. This is why I’ve kept those quotation marks around “home”. But I know this will change. Just how each devaversary (see, it’s catching on) reveals something new, I know that eventually at a future devaversary, this “home” will become a home.
.
The first step was watching the Oscars with Paolo on our first night. It helped.
.
And once again, thank you to everyone who has helped us through this experience. My gratitude knows no bounds.

"‼️Breaking News‼️Critical Bandit Tow Truck Ransoming Altadena Fire Victim’s Cars Most Likely Identified. 

It appears that I caught the Tow truck that’s been scamming the Eaton Fire victims! 

Cyrus Towing / Tow Truck on ABC 7 news in Altadena. 

The Legal Lens has most likely identified one of the bandit tow trucks featured in ABC’s story, “Officials warn of tow-truck scam targeting Eaton Fire victims”. According to ABC, after the devastation of the fires, these tow trucks told victims that they were contracted by Altadena officials to help tow cars. But the cars would be towed to hidden locations and then ransomed for over $3,000. (Disclaimer: Identification of the Altadena bandit tow truck is not conclusive until verified by the government, and all accused are presumed innocent.)

" New Single Out Soon: “Pacific Coast Highway” 

Originally written by Courtney Love and Billy Corgan, first performed by Hole, Pacific Coast Highway was Courtney’s ode to loss—missing someone who could never return. But for me, it speaks to something different: chasing someone who will never understand me, who can’t reciprocate.

I was in the Palisades Fire when it tore through the hills, surrounded by chaos, watching the world burn. But even then, I heard the voice of God on the Pacific Coast Highway—and that was enough to curb any loneliness I might have felt.

This song is about longing, surrender, and finding solace where you least expect it. My share of the royalties is going straight to the Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods. Hope you hear something in it too.

"Let me tell you a story about nineteen neighbors from Beautiful Altadena and one heroic man from the Pacific Palisades. At first look into the destruction of our towns, it’s hard to see past the brutality of the fires. But there is this. The more you lean in, and if stare a little longer, and if you talk to everyone you see, you begin to notice the divine beauty in all of it. I know the images are hard to look at and can bring sadness to you. But, if you were afforded the opportunity like I have been, to stare patiently into the melted glass, you would start to see something different. 
A photo of the moon, no matter how large or brilliant, cannot change the tide. You have to be the moon. So, with your help, I am going to bring the moon to you, so that, in turn, you may become the moon as well. Because when something so brilliant and bright such as this shines in your face, illuminated by the Son, you become what you are looking at and looking for. And then you can change the tide.
This is not a story of destroyed cars, homes and the sadness that this tragedy brings. This is a story of resilience in the face of immense adversity. A story of a community, that when challenged with the impossible, thrives like none other. This is a story of love and compassion for your fellow man. This story is told through the cars we love and the people that love them. I love you Altadena.  I also love you Pacific Palisades.  Love everyone.  I love your dream.

"In the weeks following the fires, I read too many op-eds and social media posts asking:
• “Why would anyone build in these areas in the first place?”
• “Should we really rebuild here?”
• “Maybe this is a sign that people shouldn’t live there at all.”

Much of it was written by people who don’t live in Los Angeles and don’t understand its geography. The reality is that Los Angeles is a city defined by nature—mountains surround it, mountains cut through it, mountains shape it. Nearly every part of Los Angeles brushes up against wild, drought-prone, flammable terrain. That’s simply the nature of the place we call home.

Telling people not to rebuild isn’t just impractical—it ignores the reality of Los Angeles. The question isn’t whether we rebuild, but how. 

Head over to my blog to read my thoughts on how we can rebuild smarter in a smarter, more resilient Los Angeles.

"Introducing the Altadena Resilient Rebuild ️  In response to the devastating Eaton Fire, I have been helping multiple homeowners in Altadena navigate the rebuilding process. Now, I am launching the Altadena Resilient Rebuild—a collective effort designed to help the entire neighborhood recover faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost.

Through California Home Designs, I’ve partnered with my builder to streamline the rebuild of up to 300 homes, creating semi-custom, high-quality homes that integrate fire-resistant materials, modern construction, and sustainable design—exceeding California’s latest wildfire and building standards.

With 20 years of experience in housing, design, and urban planning, I’ve worked to create stronger, more livable communities. I recently became Wildfire Defense Certified with CAL FIRE & USGBC-CA, further strengthening my ability to support resilient rebuilding efforts. Now, I am applying that knowledge to help homeowners rebuild smarter and safer—starting in Altadena, a community in Los Angeles County with modest lots and compact homes.

Rebuilding as a unified community offers key benefits:
✅ Lower costs – Bulk purchasing reduces material and labor expenses.
✅ Faster timelines – Coordinated permitting and construction accelerate rebuilding.
✅ Wildfire resilience – Strengthening homes together improves neighborhood safety.
✅ More housing – ADUs expand living space and housing options 

 If you or someone you know in Altadena is looking to rebuild, fill out the interest form (link featured at top of  profile bio @californiahomedesigns): https://altadenaresilientrebuild.typeform.com/quote

 Contact me or comment below for more information on the Altadena Resilient Rebuild.

"The recent fires—the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire in Altadena, among many others—have left their mark on our beloved tennis community, but together, we can rebuild stronger than ever.  The USTA Southern California Section is accepting donations to our Southern California Natural Disaster Relief Fund to assist tennis facilities, coaches, umpires, and players impacted.

The Palisades Tennis Center and the Altadena Town & Country Club facilities are more than just courts—they are hubs for communities, spaces where friendships are built, dreams are fostered, and future champions are born.  Though these fires have challenged us, our resilience and love for the game remain unshaken. 

With your support, we can restore these cherished spaces, reignite the joy of tennis for players of all ages, and ensure that our community continues to thrive. Every contribution, no matter the size, helps rebuild not just facilities but the spirit of Southern California tennis.

"Woof  

My name is River Solik and I was adopted by my Paw-ents @mrs_solik_esq @johnsolik on 2/8/25 

I’m a LA Wildfire survivor as I belonged to a wonderful lady named Toni @awishforanimalsorg and we lost our home 

Our house was destroyed in the LA Wildfire in the Pacific Palisades   I was hurt, devastated and sad for a long time.  I was just a couple weeks old when Toni got me so my whole routine changed after the fires, in the worst possible way!

So at 1st, I went to a foster who loved me so much that she bought me a new bed, different types of toys and lots of treats!  She bought me a shark, not a real one….but a stuffed animal shark   It’s literally my favorite toy to this day!  Sharks rule!  It’s big but I carry it every chance I get and sleep with my shark-y in my crate every night.  Anyway, my foster Mommy, Marina, had me for a few weeks until my Paw-ents adopted me.

For my Mommy, she said it was love at 1st sight!  She found me on A Wish for Animals Instagram and as she likes to say, she “had to have me!”

When my adopted Mommy came to visit me on February 8, 2025, it was like “Ok…who is this crazy, energetic lady giving me all these kisses when she barely even knows me?” She took a lot of pictures with me!  It’s like her obsession, which is weird.  So here is our 1st picture together.

Do you like it?

"From the Pacific Palisades Historical Society: It’s hard to find a silver lining when a community is devastated, with half its homes destroyed—far more than half in the town’s heart. So let’s not pretend there is one. Yet, just three years after celebrating our town’s centennial, we now face the rare opportunity—and responsibility—of envisioning what we want Pacific Palisades to become. Palisades 2.0. The Renaissance of the Palisades in its second century.

Maybe that vision is “as close as can be to the Palisades of January 6, 2025.” As history buffs, we want to salvage as much as possible of landmark sites. Many who rebuild will try to replicate what was lost—though that won’t be entirely feasible due to building code upgrades and fire-resistant materials.

But even the most devoted Palisadians know our community had its shortcomings. Narrow Alphabet streets. Overhead power lines. Landslide-prone areas. Gaps in cellular connectivity. Increasingly non-native vegetation—once scenic but now scorched—posing a wildfire risk. And the woefully inadequate emergency evacuation routes.

So maybe the vision is: “Let’s be thoughtful, keeping what we cherish while designing a community better prepared for the future.” Resilience and sustainability must be at the heart of rebuilding.

We could go on raising more questions, but we’d rather listen to you. What should the future of the Palisades look like?

Share your thoughts—your ideas will help shape the conversations we’re having with community leaders and city officials.

"The JAACP media panelist’s presented the devastation that the Palisades and Franklin fires brought to the local community. They also bring awareness to the accuracy of breaking news and how impactful it can be to create space for individuals impacted by those in the greater Los Angeles area. One key takeaway the panelist’s made known is the impact of our mental health and well being covering stories such as these.

"""The Magnitude of the Little Losses"" is about the bittersweet freedom of losing everything—the unexpected relief of letting go of burdens and the heartache of losing the irreplaceable. It’s the little things—the drawings, the ornaments, the little things--that hurt the most.

"Was in the Palisades fire burn area again today in Castellammare and Palisades Highlands. The fire in the Highlands hit a lot of attached condos. Fire destroyed the homes more hit and miss, one on one block, one on another block. It didn't just plow through blocks of homes like it did in the flats. I saw one cleared lot in Castellammare today. I don't know how they will ever get big trucks up there as the roads as narrow, steep, curvy, further narrowed by debris slides and road closures. #palisadesfire #marycummins #realestateappraiser #losangeles #california #postfireappraisal",1024300882,https://www.instagram.com/p/DG69K3zpyqi/,2025-03-08 02:13:31+00:00

"When my boyfriend bought this home only 5 months prior, the kids walked in and promptly called it “Heaven” for the marine layer that blankets the Malibu coast below us. Is this the real 9 Cloud Ln.?! The greenest pastures wrapped the house on all sides, promising to become home for the animals we dream of, the projects we’ll build and the people we’ll make memories with in the coming years. It was a dream come true in every way. 
.
2 months ago today, we fought the #palisades #Fire as it consumed everything around us. While my boyfriend packed up the truck with family photos and mementos, we left with time to grab our dogs and run. Why I left with only two iPhone chargers and a dog leash in my hands still baffles me to this day. It’s so not me not to pack tools and art and the great-grandparents’ silverware. 
.
There were so many events that stacked up over the next hours and days that I’ll share in more detail soon, but after driving through fire, putting embers out in my hair, and finding a fire engine to come use our hydrants and defensible space as a base camp, our house survived while the rest of the property and ADU burned to the ground. We are still displaced but lucky not only to be alive, but to have something to come home to. 
.
I will never forget watching home after home be consumed in minutes by a relentless fire stoked by ravaging winds that ripped apart everything in its path at a 90 mph quip. We had no business seeing what we saw, staying that close to what could have turned out a very different way at the whim of the wind. And after the dust settled we saw how and where and what made us so lucky and who and why others were not as fortunate. God bless those who lost lives, life savings, pets and precious mementos. 
.
So this is our new normal. First the Lahaina fire and wind event, then the Franklin Fire that grew too close for comfort back in December and now the Palisades Fire, all lessons in safety, humility, perseverance and gratitude, forever burned into our hearts. 
.
I’ve never been so ready to keep building. ❤️#fire #palisadesfire #malibufire #topanga #defensiblespace #firefighter #home #preparedness #carpenter #tvhost",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DG7CX7OpOZt/,2025-03-08 02:59:00+00:00

"Happy International Women’s Day! 
.
Today I’m thinking about all the ladies who have helped shape my life, the fantastic women I meet daily in my role as a climate journalist, and all the women journalists working today and those who came before us. 
.
Journalism is duality at its finest - sometimes hard yet easy, challenging yet rewarding, defeating yet purpose-driven. 
.
A few months ago while home sick after covering the #palisadesfire, I watched Kate Winslet’s movie “Lee” - the story of photographer Lee Miller who was a correspondent during WW2. I had never heard about Lee, but was left feeling inspired by her, and the work we’re doing today to fight injustice everywhere. 
.
I couldn’t be more proud of the work we’re doing- and will continue to try to use that as fuel, when the news cycle burnout tests us to quit. 
.
No matter what, we are strong, and stronger together.

"After devastating fires swept through Altadena, Malibu, and the Pacific Palisades, two USTA SoCal Adult League teams—Malibu’s “Loosely Strung” and Altadena’s “Band of Brothers”—overcame adversity to compete at Sectionals. Despite losing their home courts and experiencing personal losses, both teams decided to press forward, using tennis as a source of resilience and connection. Their participation in Sectionals was not just about competition but a testament to their determination, camaraderie, and the strength of their communities in the face of hardship.

Use the link in our bio to read their full story. 

Support their recovery by donating to the USTA Southern California Natural Disaster Fund and help rebuild tennis communities affected by disaster.

"It’s been a little over two months since our home burned down, and grief has come and gone in waves.

Today, we’re hitting the next milestone that I honestly didn’t anticipate feeling like such a punch in the gut… the city is coming in to remove the debris at our lot and will be bulldozing the rest.

I logically know that there’s nothing left, but I can’t quiet that nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I missed something valuable somewhere in the ashes.

In the spirit of celebrating our wins, here’s a look back at the treasures that we DID find during the few days we were able to dig around…

1. My sister, my brother-in-law, and me - suited up and ready to dig.

2. My mom and I in the middle of our lot on the first day we could get in.

3. A clay heart necklace I made in kindergarten that says “Mom.”

4. Mom’s beloved Christmas china, which she took years to piece together the full collection.

5. The only sheet of paper we found… a page out of a Hungarian language lesson book; my dad was born in Hungary and left as a refugee in the 1950’s, so this was particularly miraculous.

6. The only chess piece left from my grandpa’s chess set.

7. A vase my dad bought in China during his early travels.

8. A porcelain baby doll arm from my great grandmother’s doll (my family thinks this is spooky but you better believe I took that arm home and she’s all cleaned up!!)

9. Pearls that my mom bought herself as a gift in her 20’s.

10. The wrought iron patio set that we’ve eaten countless dinners on in the backyard over the last 30+ years.

11. This technically is cheating because it’s in front of the neighbors house - but our neighborhood “library!”

12. Thanks for scrolling this far… and being so supportive during this time!

"SAVED: The home of MGM art director Cedric Gibbons and Mexican-born actress Dolores Del Rio.

Gibbons, who brought the Art Deco aesthetic to film & designed the Oscar statuette, met Del Rio at a party at Hearst Castle. Their Streamline Moderne-style love nest was designed with architect Douglas Honnold in 1929. With the main living area on the upper floor, legend has it Del Rio slept upstairs & Gibbons downstairs with a trap door connecting them. Unfortunately, the pair divorced in 1941 after Del Rio had an affair with Orson Welles. 

The house, recently restored by @kac.design & @madelinedstuart, still retains its theatricality with black linoleum floors shiny enough for Fred Astaire. Though the house was in the evacuation zone, thankfully, flames never reached the neighborhood.

"Happy MAR10 Day!
.
On this holy nerd holiday I want to share another glimmer of delight amongst my yearlong cavalcade of garbage fuel.
.
Last year as I was dealing with my dad’s cancer diagnosis and ultimately passing away, one of the biggest chores was moving my mom out of my childhood home and getting her into a smaller space. During that time as I was cleaning out my old room and storage, I found SO many childhood treasures. The largest of which, was my original Nintendo Entertainment System. It was in perfect condition, complete with many games, instruction books, and even in an official Nintendo storage case. I immediately rediscovered all the joy I originally felt when I was a tiny kid opening that box on Christmas morning. I still remember my dad doing that old nugget, “Wait, I think I see one last present hiding behind the curtain…”
.
And yet, while it was wonderful discovering that artifact of my gaming history, I never figured I’d actually play it again. I mean, I have all the latest gaming systems to satiate my desires. So I left my old NES at my mom’s new home in Utah. That way every time I go back to visit her, I could smile when I saw it.
.
Well, that all changed on January 7th, when my PS5, my Nintendo Switch, my VR headsets, even all my older systems I saved (like my Nintendo 64, GameCube, Gameboys, PS4, etc), were instantly obliterated in the fires. Suddenly I had nothing for gaming anymore. For you non-gamers out there, you’re probably saying, eh you have bigger fish to fry. And while that’s true, gamers like me realize how important that escape really is. I love gaming and suddenly I lost all of that history as well. But wait, not ALL was lost…
.
Yep, I was able to recapture my old NES, and bring it back with me to my new place in LA. Now, on this MAR10 Day, I can play the original Super Mario Brothers, in its original system, with my original controller that young Jeff actually used. So I may not have all the latest tech anymore, but I can still recapture some of that same childhood gaming joy. So today it’s all about Mario. Next up? Zelda.

" The recent Palisades fires destroyed 1,300 multifamily units and mobile homes as well as 770 apartments designed to be rent controlled. 

This represents almost all of the affordable housing options in the Palisades. 

And now, with fierce opposition from wealthy residents against rebuilding low-income housing, the future of economic diversity in this neighborhood is on the line.

Housing inequality in the Palisades has always been an issue, but this disaster could push it to a breaking point. 

Will rent-controlled housing be replaced, or will the city’s most vulnerable residents be pushed out for good? 

LA has tough decisions ahead, and this conversation needs to be had.

Drop your thoughts below, and if you have questions about how this affects the market, let’s talk.

"As time passed, everything descended into darkness. Winds gusted, embers flew, ashes fell, sirens blared, and fire engulfed everything in its path mercilessly. 

Firefighters tried their hardest to curb the spread, but the relentless wind worked against them. 

I was an ordinary bystander witnessing glimpses of hell. 

Watching this unfold, I realized - I couldn’t even begin to fathom what war must look like.

"Wisdom isn’t given. It’s earned.

Through experience.

Through struggle.

Through the moments that shape us in ways we never asked for or expected.

Looking back, I can’t say I liked every season, action or decision, but I can say I have nothing but love for every past version of myself.

He was doing the best he could with what he knew. 
And every challenge, every misstep, every breakthrough… led me here.

More aligned.

More clear.

More in tune with who I am, my purpose, my values, and what truly matters.

Wherever you are right now - honor it.

Look back only to see how far you’ve come. Then keep moving forward.

Trust that every experience - good and bad - is shaping you into who you are meant to be.

"Enjoy the Silence ️
I just got the hit to put down my phone and tap out of social media for a bit. So that I can truly feel IN and then move OUT of this massive metamorphosis that I AM currently very much IN. When you lose everything, you have the opportunity to build from the ground up. Both literally and metaphorically.
And I am quite busy doing both of those while also being a very hands on Mom and wife. 
This life changing plot twist deserves a heightened level of respect and honor ⚔️ 
This is such a gift even amidst the gutting heartbreak
And I want to fully embrace it all, not bypass any important steps or the exquisite silence with myself 
Time is my most precious commodity. 
I no longer feel the desire to give it away so freely right now. I mostly do enjoy social media but it all feels very dull and boring to me at the moment (it’s me not you). And so I am not going to force myself. I always orient myself towards FREEDOM and this is no different. 
So I’ll be back when I’m back.
There will be much to share soon enough. 
Love ya’ll!

As fires burned in January, organizations like @DirectRelief rushed in to help, and continue to help today. 

Amgen and the Amgen Foundation supported this effort through a donation of $10 million which went to wildfires relief efforts led by the @CalFund, the @launitedway, and Direct Relief.

Headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, Amgen and its employees have called Southern California its home for more than four decades and its connection to the community runs deep.

As the road to recovery continues, we remain committed to helping these communities rebuild.

"How do you insure and rebuild communities in fire-prone, high-value areas. For @wsj ✨

Reporter Kevin T. Dugan explores the aftermath of the devastating wildfires in Pacific Palisades and the broader implications for California’s real estate, insurance industry, and rebuilding efforts. 

After wildfires tore through Pacific Palisades, the battle to rebuild isn’t just about construction—it’s about who will cover the costs. With insurance companies reluctant to take on new policies and State Farm pushing for a 22% rate hike, homeowners are left in limbo.

Mayor Bass appointed real estate developer Steve Soboroff as Chief Recovery Officer to manage rebuilding efforts, but backlash over his $500,000 salary led to his decision to work for free. He is unlikely to stay past April. Meanwhile, billionaire Rick Caruso, whose luxury mall was saved by private firefighters, launched a nonprofit with executives from JPMorgan Chase and Palantir to restore the Palisades to its pre-fire state.

Architect Arika-Paloma Urquidez and her brother Armaund Urquidez lost their childhood home in the fires. The siblings have been trying to persuade residents to stay and rebuild. One official involved in the recovery estimated that three of four Palisades residents won’t move back. 

“I had my first kiss on that point right there,” said Urquidez, and gestured toward the bluff where her mother’s house stood before it turned to ash.

“I always thought that I would raise my children here,” she said. “I don’t see it ever being the same.” #pacificpalisades #palisadesfire",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DHJq1YCS0AG/,2025-03-13 19:21:54+00:00

"Tonight, neighbors from Sun Valley, Arleta, North Hollywood, Shadow Hills, and beyond came together for the Phase 2 cleanup hearing of the Eaton and Palisades fires and their impact on Sun Valley as it houses some of the city landfills. City and business representatives outlined the process, fielding community concerns—though, as expected, responses felt scripted and lacked the depth and reassurance many hoped for.

Still, we recognize the importance of showing up. Town hall meetings can be uncomfortable for officials facing passionate residents, but their presence matters. More importantly, your presence matters. To everyone who attended, asked questions, and advocated for their health—thank you! Your voices remind us that our community does care about its exposure to toxins, and that fuels us to keep showing up, too.

As a health- and sustainability-focused coffee cart in a neighborhood with few clean food options, tonight reignited our hope. Beyond these hearings, we encourage all of us to reflect: How can we minimize toxin exposure in our daily lives? Fires are an unfortunate reality in our region, and the materials in our homes—plastics, synthetic fibers, and chemical-laden goods—can release harmful toxins not just when burned but also when simply un packaging or worse, with daily use. Even if they don’t burn down, they still pollute our landfills and air over time.

As consumers, we vote with our dollars. Invest in natural, toxin-free products, avoid plastic-heavy goods, and choose organic whole foods when possible. Small choices add up. Because protecting our community isn’t just about cleanup—it’s about prevention.

"Super interesting event tomorrow, Sunday March 16th, with the Pacific Palisades Historical Society and Santa Monica Conservancy! A must watch for anyone interested in the #rebuilding of the Palisades!

The Way We Were: Shared Memories of a Village Lost (Santa Monica Mosaic) Sunday, March 16, 5 - 6 p.m. No cost. Virtual Admission

Discover the rich history of the Pacific Palisades. Live Zoom Event. An afternoon livestream event celebrating the history of the Palisades with historians and journalists, business members, and community leaders, who have made a lasting impact in their local community and present their stories of heritage and loss from the Palisades wildfire.

For this episode of Santa Monica Mosaic, four key members of our devastated neighboring community, Pacific Palisades, will reflect on the region’s rich history, fond memories of life in their cherished village, and their hopes for the recovery ahead. With a deep connection to the Palisades spanning decades, Mosaic moderator Libby Motika will lead conversations with the former editor of the Palisadian-Post; a longtime community advocate; and a member of the founding family of a beloved legacy business, destroyed in the fire.  The discussions will begin with an overview of local history by the curator of the Pacific Palisades Historical Society—a program partner that will contribute a wealth of historical photos to the show.

Meet Our Panelists:
Randy Young, curator, Pacific Palisades Historical Society
Roberta Donohue, longtime Palisades advocate
Vanessa Pellegrini, founding family member, of Vittorio Ristorante
Bill Bruns, former editor, of Palisadian-Post.

"That cycling scene gatekeeping? Stops at the door. It doesn’t come in here. 

⚠️ NO DROP, NO RUSH: Road bike beginner’s Ride ⚠️

 March 16, 2025
 Meet at Esquina: 8:00 AM
⏳ Roll Out: 8:30 AM
 25 Miles – Moderate Pace – Social & Training Ride
⚠️ Beginner ride for road bikes (hybrids are ok) 
️ Riding through the city, catch the LA river north, and loop back through NELA 

We know there’s a lot of gatekeeping and ego in the road bike male-driven cycling scene. Too much road bike-shaming, too many people acting like they were never beginners. Not here. This ride is for those who have been pushed away by that culture—for the road cycling-curious, the long-distance hopefuls, those on a health journey, for non-male riders, and anyone looking for a safe, ego-free space to learn and road ride.

Maybe you’re riding a vintage steel bike, a $10k dream build, or something you got secondhand. No matter what you ride, if you’re looking for an open and supportive cycling space, this is your ride.

What to Expect:

✅ No egos. No bike shaming. No dumb questions.
✅ A no-drop pace—everyone stays together.
✅ Seasoned riders to answer questions.
✅ Social ride + space to learn road cycling basics.
✅ Women, POC, non-binary, femme, lgbtq, cyclists encouraged to join.

 Q&A can be asked privately to our seasoned riders or ask out loud! 

 All you need is a road bike, a helmet, and an open mind. Let’s build something together.

Tag a friend who’s been wanting to start cycling and let’s ride!

"Haden Kirkpatrick, State Farm’s Vice President for Innovation and Venture Capital, was fired after being secretly recorded making controversial remarks about the company’s proposed 22% premium hike in California following devastating wildfires. 

The recording, published by O’Keefe Media Group, captured Kirkpatrick stating that the company sought the rate increase due to a $5 billion shortfall and threatened policy cancellations if the hike was denied.

He also made comments about homeowners in wildfire-prone areas like Pacific Palisades, calling their desire for natural surroundings “ego-driven” and labeling the region a “tinderbox” due to its desert-like conditions.

State Farm responded by terminating Kirkpatrick, asserting that his comments were inaccurate and did not reflect the company’s stance. Kirkpatrick claimed he was set up during what he believed to be a Tinder date but declined further comment.

"Yesterday, I opened the trunk of our car and found something Liv journaled during our evacuation in the Palisades Fire. I had no recollection of her reactions in the car, even though friends have asked me about it.

She never discussed how it felt with us, and we never wanted to probe, not wanting to add more drama to our lives as she has taken all of this in stride. 

But finding it hit so deeply.

She doesn’t see Sadie anymore. We’re thousands of miles away. Our lives bear no resemblance to what they were. The universe of alternate possibilities floods my mind.

Life can change in a heartbeat, and finding this entry startled me anew — a reminder of just how fragile and precious each day is.

We made it through that day, but it’s these moments of reflection that have reminded me to never take anything for granted. As much as you want to, you can’t live every moment being grateful because being human doesn’t allow us to be that singular in our focus at all times.  #Gratitude #SlidingDoors #Reflecting #PalisadesFire",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DHTwpmeOxdF/,2025-03-17 17:25:08+00:00
"How This Simple System Saved a Home from Burning Down in a Wildfire

 Imagine evacuating your home… thinking it’s gone forever.

That’s exactly what happened to the Johnson family in Los Angeles. A wildfire broke out overnight, forcing them to flee with nothing but their bags.

When they returned, their neighbors’ homes were burned to the ground.  But theirs? Completely untouched.

 Was it luck? NO. It was their secret weapon: Wild Fire Protector’s Roof Irrigation System.

 Here’s why it worked:
✔ Kept their roof too wet for embers to ignite
✔ Created a moisture barrier to stop flames before they spread
✔ Manually Activated in 3 seconds—no firefighters needed

Wildfires are unpredictable. The only way to win is to prepare BEFORE disaster strikes.

"The craziest thing about this sweatshirt is that it is the very first sweatshirt I ever painted. I started from the back on the Friday before the fires only because I thought the line signified a play-on PCH, which was my route from Palisades to our Malibu office, and I loved the color combo of Pink and Red. I never would have thought, in my wildest nightmare, that the following Tuesday, Jan.7th, it would signify so much more.

"Today, Democratic Caucus Chair and Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood) announced AB 478, the FOUND Act, Friends of Oreo Uniting During Disasters, a critical new bill to ensure that companion animals are protected during emergencies and that local governments implement clear procedures to support pet owners during evacuations. Sponsored by Social Compassion in Legislation, the bill was inspired by the heartwarming story of Oreo, as seen on the Today Show, a Pomeranian who went missing during the Palisades Fire and survived for five days in the debris before being reunited with his owner.

“Pets are more than just property—they are family. When disaster strikes, no one should have to choose between their safety and their pet’s survival,” said Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur. “The FOUND Act ensures that local governments have clear rescue plans in place, so pet owners don’t have to risk their lives to save their animals. While we’ve seen incredible examples of fire and safety officials working alongside the public to reunite pets with their families, as well as the extraordinary efforts of local animal shelters and rescuers, we owe it to pet owners across California to ensure that every city and county has a plan in place before disaster strikes.”

“Time and time again, we’ve seen animals abandoned or lost in the chaos of wildfires and other disasters,” said Judie Mancuso, Founder and President of Social Compassion in Legislation. “This bill is about making sure animal family members are not left behind. Our beloved companion animals are not like a pair of prescription glasses, they are sentient beings that must be rescued. The bill provides the necessary tools to coordinate rescues, support evacuees, and reunite families with their beloved animals.”

Transferring schools and selecting a new one last fall was already challenging, but leaving our community made it even harder. Now, on top of literally losing his new school to the Palisades fire and seeing the @marquezcharterofficial community split apart is truly heartbreaking. ❤️‍

"I’m so proud of @theantonioneves whose newest book, The 1 Day Method, is out today on @amazon.

We wouldn’t wish the experience of losing everything on anyone, but at the same time, we’re going to make the best of this tragedy (because that’s who we are and that’s what we do).

Prior to the fire, Antonio had been working on The 1 Day Method and testing it with groups and clients.

When our home burned to the ground, we both used this method to stay productive during what could have been total chaos.

One day at a time, we focused on what was most important, self-care, and how we were going to use our limited and precious time wisely.

This book shows you how to do small things - every day - that can lead to big change. 

Get your copy today and join me in congratulating my husband for turning a tragedy into inspiration!

"Kids Caring for Kids – Join Us in Spreading Comfort!
 
At Cayton Children’s Museum, we believe in the power of play, kindness, and community. That’s why we’re partnering with Teddy Bear Project—a global initiative that has provided comfort to children impacted by war, natural disasters, and trauma for over 20 years.
 
On Friday, March 21st, children visiting the Cayton can take part in a special Kids Caring for Kids activity. Museum guests will have the chance to create heartfelt cards in our Art Studio (10 AM–1 PM) to attach to teddy bears that will be given to children affected by the LA fires.
 
Then, on Saturday, March 22nd, children directly impacted by the fires will receive a bear to take home—a small but meaningful token of comfort and care.

How you can help:
 
— Visit Cayton Children’s Museum on March 21 to participate
 
— Donate to support this initiative (Link in Bio)
 
— Help spread the word by sharing this post
 
Let’s come together to show that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference.

"I hadn’t been anywhere near Malibu since the Palisades Fire, until today. 

Kevin @laobserved and I have been meeting for lunch in Malibu for at least 23 years. It’s a semi-regular thing, about three or four times a year since I moved back to California. But it’s been awhile, for two reasons: Kevin moved to Redondo Beach, and then the Palisades Fire severed PCH, the main artery for his northbound drive. But Kevin made the very long drive today around the roadblock, through the Valley and over Malibu Canyon to meet me at Marmalade. The restaurant, always crowded, was almost deserted. 

“It’s been so bad,” said our waitress. “You can see what it’s like. It’s because of the road closure. But we’re hanging in there. Thanks for your concern.”

Parking at Malibu Lagoon? No problem. Visiting the Malibu Pier? No crowds at all. “It’s finally picking up,” said the hostess at The Farm, the restaurant on the pier. “But yeah, it’s been very, very slow since they closed PCH.”

And it’s not just there. Most days It’s almost impossible to get anywhere near the El Matador Beach parking lot. Today? Not a problem. 

This closure, from Malibu to Santa Monica, will likely last quite awhile. Malibu businesses could use your support right now.

Bird photos are from Malibu Lagoon. Fourth photo was taken from the pier, a long-distance view of a few of the homes on PCH destroyed in the Palisades Fire.

"This set was extraordinarily difficult for me and it took over two weeks for me to even sit down and edit, especially since I see this fire as the defining event that burned away the last of my innocence. The beach was my home, it was where I grew up, and last year, it’s where I returned to find myself again, returning to the sea as a way of returning to my younger self. I surfed, I escaped my problems when I laid in the sand, and it’s where I spent the last days of my horribly toxic relationship. The Reel Inn was “our spot.” I found toxicity everywhere I looked as I rode down PCH in early March. The destruction is symbolic of how I feel on the inside, projected all over the last place I was able to feel at peace in summer of 2024, as fleeting and naive as it was. I will miss you Malibu  I truly hope we can rebuild as a community and overcome this historic heartbreak. One day I will surf you again.. #palisadesfire #pch #malibu",213873866,https://www.instagram.com/p/DHeX83ESCF_/,2025-03-21 20:20:57+00:00
"Busy week working out in the Palisades. This wildfire is absolutely devastating. Seeing the damage up close hits different. Grateful we can help in some small way.

"This week we went home to Pacific Palisades to meet up with  volunteers who shoveled and raked through the ashes, looking for anything that survived. Several hours later they only found 7 of the 8 reindeer mugs, and both Vixen plates (my favorite reindeer). Everything else, besides the charred appliances, is ash and rubble. These volunteers travel to disasters nationwide and they said this is one of the worst they have ever seen. It’s still all very heavy as we navigate this new post-fire recovery life; logistically and emotionally it’s A LOT. We collapsed at the end of that day. #palisadesfire #onedayatatime #vixen ",219645167,https://www.instagram.com/p/DHehiJ0SefC/,2025-03-21 21:44:41+00:00

"Painted @mikaelasarah ‘s lovely home with the stunning jacaranda that was lost to the Palisades fire.  it was very special and sad to paint such vibrant colors knowing they no longer exist. Houses hold a million memories, and though I had never been, I could feel the lives lived in it and warmth it contained from the photo.  I hoped I did it justice. 

If anyone affected by the fires wants a painting of their home, DM me. Free of charge for victims (while I have capacity). If you’d like to gift one to someone affected, im offering 50% off to just cover materials/time. I I would love to bring warmth into people’s new homes.

"Supporting Small Businesses Matters Now More Than Ever

This post was originally meant to be shared to bring awareness to the importance of supporting small businesses—but now, it’s even more urgent. We just got the news that our building is up for sale.

Small businesses like Esquina are what make communities thrive. When you shop local, you’re not just buying a product—you’re investing in people, culture, and the future of your neighborhood.

We’re grateful for everyone who has supported us, and now more than ever, we need to show up for the businesses that make our communities unique. We’ll keep you updated on what’s next—stay with us.

"73 days ago on 1/7/25 the palisades fire began. Four days later we had the opportunity of joining @wckitchen in providing for first responders and residents. We are currently 69 days in and have served over 25,000 

They have literally been the cavalry and the only organization to still show up. I couldn’t be more proud and in awe of an organization that has been a constant in both Palisades and Altadena providing food, potable water, fresh fruits vegetables for the residents and providing resources for the small businesses that have been affected by the devastating fires. To call this a movement wouldn’t do it justice. 
.
The last 69 days would not have been made possible without @chefjoseandres the founder of World Central Kitchen
.
Last night we were given the opportunity to share in the moment in which he was recognized @sofistadium for his humanitarian work and spent time with everyone that has made all of this possible that are now my friends ♥️
