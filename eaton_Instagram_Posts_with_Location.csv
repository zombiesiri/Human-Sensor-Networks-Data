My home is gone. 
I‚Äôll never stop praying for the safety and strength of my neighbors and all first responders. I do not know what will come next after this unimaginable loss but I am sure of just one thing: that the God of Love and Compassion is with me and has shown up in the form of loving people. My next door neighbors who watered the roof of my home. Friend who delivered groceries to me. Others delivered clothes for us. My cousin Alyson on the east coast, texted early this morning to check in. My siblings have checked in. Friends have offered my family place to stay. My family has been added to the prayer list at All Saints Church.  Strangers have walked my dog and wiped my tears. I Was so relieved to hear from a cousin who lives nearby that she is safe and with her daughter. My prayer is that everyone will receive all the love and care they so desperately need in this moment. As soon as I am able, I pray that I can be  part of the healing and rebuilding that is ahead for our community. 
I am in shock, heartbroken AND eternally grateful.  Stay safe, take care of yourselves and each other. xxK #altadenastrong #eatonfire",2025-01-08 21:42:35+00:00

We humans have not learned our lesson. 

So you call in the Spirit of Wind üå¨Ô∏è 
to magnify your message to us. 

You bring us devastating loss, terror and fear. You remind us how small and un mighty we truly are, when we try to walk alone as just one. 

But what if this was instead our last lesson, the one in which we all finally chose to awaken. We realize it‚Äôs not our material gains and adornments. Our flash and our privilege. 

But rather our humbled humility, when realized we are stronger together, than in competition apart. That home is carried inside us, no matter where we ever, are. 

What if we bowed in devotion and really vowed to change? 

My heart is with friends, loved ones and those I call family who‚Äôve just lost everything.

Hundreds of homes burned to the ground.
Over 100k people told to evacuate.
Los Angeles cut their fire services budget last year by 17.6 million dollars. 
Insurance companies in California have stopped writing new fire insurance policies and cancled 72,000 policies last year.

For the heroic EMT and firefighters. I love you so much. Fearless men and women, some coming from Arizona and others coming from Oregon to help local fire teams here in California. Warms the heart knowing they're fighting, even as I type this up. It's traumatizing being out there. Believe what you see.

I wanted to share an update and let you know that we are back home and safe in Pasadena. On Tuesday night, we evacuated soon after we learned about the Eaton Fire, which was uncomfortably close to our home. These past few days have felt like a month‚Äî a mix of sadness, fear and uncertainty that are hard to describe.

We‚Äôre incredibly grateful that our house is okay and that the evacuation warning for our area was lifted yesterday. However, our hearts are heavy for LA and for everyone directly impacted by this horrific fire. We‚Äôre especially devastated for our neighbors, friends and colleagues in Altadena, a community so close to us in every way. Altadena has been such a beautiful and special place, home to many of our favorite cafes, restaurants, and shops‚Äîso many of which are now gone.

Every day, we‚Äôre hearing more stories of people we know, and people they know, who have lost everything. The level of destruction is truly unimaginable, and yet it‚Äôs just blocks away. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected, and we‚Äôre keeping them in our prayers as they begin the difficult journey of healing and recovery.

We‚Äôre still uncertain about what‚Äôs next and are just trying to take things one moment at a time. The strength and generosity of our city, and the Pasadena and Altadena communities, are bringing us hope. Although we just moved here 5 years ago, we love LA so much and feel so grateful to call it home.

Thank you for your love, support, and for checking in on us‚Äîit means more than we can say. üôèüèºüíîüôèüèΩüíî

With Gratitude, Rebecca & Deepu

Stormie is a well-behaved rottweiller who I take care of when my friends, her owners, go on vacation. They are all safe, but their home is one of the thousands that were lost in the Eaton Canyon Fire.

https://gofund.me/411f4005

Two years ago, when I was taking care of Stormie, there was a wildfire in the San Gabriel  Mountains near Azusa and it made me think about what I needed to save, if there was ever a wildfire in the hills above Altadena. I didn‚Äôt give it a lot of thought though because I thought the fire would have to go through so many houses just to get there, surely it couldn‚Äôt possibly happen. We were over 10 blocks away from the mountains. Surely it would be stopped before then. 

Well‚Ä¶last week, the impossible happened as the Eaton Canyon fire ravaged through Altadena and torched a community. Similar to the Pacific Palisades Fire, entire blocks were burned to the ground. 

This also happened to be my temporary home before I moved to Las Vegas. After I sold my house, I lived with Ron and Cyndy until I moved to LV. That room on fire behind the tree - that was my room! The garage, kitchen and living room were to the left. You can now see the back yard from the front yard. 

It‚Äôs hard to believe what I see and I can‚Äôt even imagine what my friends are going through. All their keepsakes and memories‚Ä¶GONE! The garden, fruit trees and koi pond‚Ä¶GONE! 

So I started a Go Fund Me campaign to help them with incidentals. All those little things you need just to get by add up. And when you‚Äôre stressed about big things, you don‚Äôt want to have to stress over little things, which are still important, like toys for Stormie. She loves playing tug-of-war, and let me tell you, she is strong! üí™ 

https://gofund.me/411f4005

So if you can help Stormie help her two-legged parents out, thank you. üôè I know there are many requests out there now, so I understand if you can not. Please feel free to share this with anyone in your network. 

Stormie says woof woof üê∂ thank you.

Needless to say today's volunteering was crazier than yesterday's. When we got there at noon, most volunteers were on the clothing section separating and organizing endless piles of clothes.

All of us were out in the sun throughout the shift, but the organizers at the Dream Center partnered up with local vendors and @iheartradio to provide food and drinks for everyone involved. I was also stationed in traffic control, and I cannot begin to express how amazing it was to meet so many people eager to volunteer.

This donation center was drive-thru style, so families would take their cars through the facility and volunteers would load up the vehicle with food, water and outfit bags. The goal was for each outfit bag to contain, well, prepared outfits by gender and size. Today's energy at the Dream Center was absolutely insane. Cars were wrapped around the block on both sides of the facility.

I will remain active on my stories with resources and volunteering sites throughout LA county now that I'm back in San Diego.

NO SITE IS ACCEPTING CLOTHING AT THE MOMENT!!! Most shelters and donation centers are extremely overwhelmed with donations. Please be mindful and check-in with the site organizers to find out what they need.

What they will need this week is consistent manpower and volunteers!! Get in contact with those communities that need it most. One of the main focuses at the moment will be school supplies for children, especially in #pasadena / #altadena where five schools have been damaged/destroyed by the #eatonfire . Monrovia High School is one of the locations that will be hosting families starting this week.

There are some heavy hitters here, places we‚Äôve loved so much and enjoyed while they were open. Let‚Äôs give the trails some time to heal before heading out there. Feeling blessed we‚Äôve had the opportunity to explore these places before the fires. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find in this post:

Palisades Fire Hike Closures
Eaton Fire Hike Closures
Sunset Fire Trail Closures
Hurst Fire Trail Closures
Kenneth Fire Trail Closures

We can expect trails that are part of these hikes are closed until further notice. We haven‚Äôt got the official word from the Forest Service regarding the closures of these trails in the Angeles Forest yet, but since the Angeles Forest is temporarily closed forest-wide until Jan 15th, we can expect we will get our answer soon.

This is not the final verdict of closed trails, we have to wait from the individual state, federal and city agencies for them to give the announcements before we can confirm these closures. Closures are not permanent (most of the time), give time to nature and people to heal from this. If anyone is encouraging you to hike right now, gracefully decline, until all fires are completely contained for a few days. 

ATTN: We have reached the limits of volunteers, if you decide to email now. You will be put on a reserve list. Thank you for your vested interest.

Additionally, Griffith Park is closed until further notice by the state. And a lot of @mrcaparks hikes are closed. Again, this is temporary further notice.

I‚Äôll be bringing you all an update on the stories of areas that have reopened. Please visit the last slide if you can interested in volunteering.

The correct email is lahikesofficial@gmail.com, hope to see you in the inbox!",2025-01-13 13:10:36+00:00

Sessions are via zoom and of value to those of us who have lost our homes or businesses or who have lost use of our standing structures due to smoke or fire damage. 

The sessions are for general information but we have gathered a list of questions that should help us gain a better understanding of the claims process, how to both prepare and avoid potential pitfalls falls. 

Both companies have been kind enough to join us at no fee. Both advise that there is not a rush to make decisions and that certainly not everyone needs to hire a public adjuster.

Can‚Äôt find the words to express how devasting and heartbreaking this past week has been. From losing the trails that have brought me (and so many others) so much strength to watching 1000s of homes engulfed in flames. Entire neighborhoods gone, wildlife and pets lost, and just so much gone from my beautiful California, from Los Angeles. 

‚Ä¶ but in the midst of it all California and its people have shown up to care for one another; and so have our neighbors including Mexico, Canada and 9 US States. A big shout-out to all the firefighters literally fighting this fire around the clock since Tuesday last week and into this coming week, a huge thank you to the law enforcement keeping whats left safe from looters; and the 1000s of volunteers who have shown-up to the various centers to help in any way they can. This is what community looks like, this is what California looks like. 

And Thank You @pasadenajobcenter for opening your doors to those in need and volunteers alike. 
Solo el Pueblo, Salva al Pueblo.

Pasadena Humane has taken in over 400 animals from the Eaton Fire Emergency. They are desperately in need of monetary donations to help purchase medical supplies and other resources as they start to see a significant increase in the number of burned and injured animals coming to the shelter.

These animals are suffering from smoke inhalation, singed paws, burns, dehydration, and more. They have been treating each animal based on their needs, providing fluids, oxygen, pain medications and wound care as quickly as they can.

The best way to help the animals and families who are in need is to donate. This will give them the flexibility to cover critical expenses like medical care, facility maintenance, and support for lifesaving programs that ensure every animal has the best chance at a positive outcome! 

This is a human and animal tragedy on an unimaginable scale and they are only beginning to learn of the full impact.

As the Eaton Fire emergency continues, they anticipate taking in many more animals who are in need of emergency medical care. @pasadenahumane #pasadenahumane #animalrescue #help #eatonfire #animals",2025-01-13 15:13:45+00:00

I had no words to string together to make sense of everything that has happened. My brain shut off as it took in hearing tragedy after tragedy. So many of our clients have had their homes and schools taken from them. Some have no city at all to return to, it‚Äôs beyond heartbreaking. 

I‚Äôve been trying to comprehend the severity of the situation. It‚Äôs unfathomable. LA is my home, I was born and raised here. I‚Äôve grown up going to these places that are no longer standing. I‚Äôve spent the last 8+ years working in the Palisades with a countless amount of families. My heartaches for each and everyone who has been affected by the fires. I will do my best to bring you some sort of comfort. 

I was able to safely see a few kids for classes last week and it was such a magical break from all the sadness. We were able to give parents a moment to breathe and the kids a moment to come together with their friends. I love my community so much, words cannot express my gratitude towards them. 

We will be announcing our action steps on how we will be helping our community in the next day or two. I do know that I will be opening up my home and my private studio to hold art classes for those who have been affected, hoping this will give parents a small break and kids an outlet to express themselves. Our schedule will be coming out this week ‚ù§Ô∏è 

A BIG shout out to the firefighters from all over who have come to help our city. Thank you to all the first responders who have helped keep us safe. 

Stay tuned for more to come, we are here for you my sweet and wonderful Angelenos. We will come together and try to help heal from this unimaginable pain.

I am safe out in Ventura County, but am constantly checking @watchdutyapp for updates. My family and friends are in the thick of it and it‚Äôs scary to think they could lose everything at any moment. Keeping my fingers crossed they‚Äôll be the lucky ones ü§û 

News coverage makes it easy to think that the only people losing their homes are ultra-rich celebrities and industry tycoons with waterfront properties. They have the means to rebuild easily so, who cares right? (No, they‚Äôve experienced immense loss as well)

But the reality is far from that. The Palisades is a luxury zip code, but the communities of Altadena and Pasadena are full of working class and underprivileged families who have pinched, saved and toiled for decades to afford a home (not an easy feat in CA). They had hoped to leave that home to the next generation so their children and children‚Äôs children would be spared some of the hardships they‚Äôve endured. But all of that burned up in a flash last week. The evidence of their hard work lay ruined in smoldering ashes. The impact this will have on generations to come‚Ä¶ incalculable. (Don‚Äôt even get me started on the inevitable land grab by private equity firms eager to profit off tragedy üòë)

If you are looking to help, I encourage you to seek out organizations serving the Altadena and Pasadena communities, or donate to the @gofundme of those directly impacted by the Eaton Fire. Type in Altadena/Pasadena/Eaton Fire in the GoFundMe search bar and countless funds will pop up. I‚Äôll also post the GoFundMe links for the families/friends of friends that have been affected (saved as a Highlight). Every little bit, even $5 here and there, would mean so much to those who‚Äôve lost everything. If you can‚Äôt donate, please keep sharing these stories so they‚Äôre not forgotten.

Stay safe out there, friends ‚ù§Ô∏è Pray for the people of LA üôè

Maybe you took lessons there. Maybe you sent your kid there. The owner, Sue Bray, was my guitar teacher for a while. 

Sue and her husband Pat (also a talented musician), had a lovely home on Altadena Dr. where they lived with with their 3 dogs, 2 cats, 2 turtles, and lifetime‚Äôs  collection of instruments. After the closing of the studio in Eagle Rock, Sue taught music lessons out of this home, which I would drive to once a week in the evening. 

I always loved the drive, and my time with her. Sue is one of the coolest people I‚Äôve met. She‚Äôs very chill, very even and has a generally really positive vibe. I always enjoyed seeing her beyond just improving at guitar. She‚Äôs also a bodybuilder. üí™üèº She‚Äôs 67.

Sue & Pat‚Äôs home burned to the ground, along with so many others in the Eaton Fire. With only 30 min to evacuate they sadly lost 1 cat, 2 turtles and most of their instruments. 

Two days after the fire, they dusted themselves off and played a gig Friday night. How is that for the power of music and healing? These people are incredible. I share this because I don‚Äôt know how much their GoFundMe will spread, with them being in their 60s and not on social media much. 

I know we‚Äôve all tapped deeply into our resources already, but if you can spare a few, I‚Äôd love to help out Sue and Pat. Will link the GoFundMe in my bio and stories.

We long for scenes like this one. We so miss the buzz of energy on Washington Boulevard that we‚Äôve all grown so accustomed to.

We are grieving deeply for our neighbors & friends that have lost their homes and businesses. And it is not lost on us how lucky we are that we will one day be able re-open this little corner shop. The Pasadena and Altadena communities welcomed us into our first home over 10 years ago, and they‚Äôve supported us through those early days and through the COVID pandemic and every day between and since then. Without them, we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do what we have done, growing our community across the city and into the South Bay.

For now, are waiting for PWP to confirm that our water is safe to use and drink. The full extent of the Eaton Fire‚Äôs impacts on the water supply cannot be assessed until personnel can access necessary areas and make assessments.

We know it will take years for areas around the shop to heal and rebuild, but we are using our current resources to host a fundraiser this week at our Redondo Beach location. Redondo Beach and the South Bay have shown us a warmth reminiscent of those earliest days on Washington Blvd.; and now we ask that our extended community help us to help those who made all of this possible from the start.

WAYS TO DONATE IN LAVENDER & HONEY‚ÄôS FUNDRAISER benefitting Eaton Fire Relief efforts:

(1) Donate any $ amount at our Redondo register. Simply tell our cashier at check-out & this will be added to your ticket.

(2) 50% of all sales proceeds this week through 1/17 will be donated to @wckitchen and @gofundme‚Äôs Wildfire Relief Fund.

When we moved there in 1993 it was just a shack, just dirt and 5 fruit trees. Since we didn‚Äôt have money we did everything ourselves. Took down rotten trees, planted grass, laid all the brick pavers, the works. My mom takes great pride in her home. Most of this my mom made or refurbished herself, including a lot of the art you see. 

They went to sleep last week never thinking it would all be gone in the morning, 30+ years of work all gone #EatonFire pls share

Like you, we are stunned and gutted by the destruction of our community.  Our hearts hurt for our friends and neighbors who have lost everything. We are so grateful to be safe. Holden and I left home last week due to smoke and falling ash. Rob stayed to watch the house and volunteer. We have the most lovely humans in our neighborhood and everyone is looking out for each other.
*
So much loss around every bend. Holden's amazing school - her safe place - is now gone (video above). But we are already talking about how to help rebuild.
*
I want to thank all the first responders and firefighters. Your fearlessness and dedication is awe-inspiring. I pray for you deeply and constantly. To my colleagues reporting on the fires - you are doing incredible work providing our community with vital information. There are countless volunteers who are doing everything they can to comfort others during this crisis. I see you and I can't wait to join you. 
*
I want to share a small symbol of hope. Years ago, one of the remarkable teachers at Holden's school placed a statue of St. Francis of Assisi outside the second grade classroom. He spoke to the statue and told him that ‚Äòthere are children who call this land home who need you.‚Äô The statue (second pic) is one of the only things standing after flames engulfed the campus. Saint Francis is the patron saint of all living things who chose to live a life of poverty and served those in need. Part of the Peace Prayer of Saint Francis says, ""O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love."" 
‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®

LA is hurting. I am praying for the safety and restoration of a community I love. There is so much healing to do, but we will begin again. #Californiafires #Eatonfire #LosAngeles #Love #Hope",2025-01-13 17:00:48+00:00

A 25% increase. Noticing a trend of leasing agents not putting their name or contact info because they know what they‚Äôre doing is wrong. This property was for rent at $10,000 a year ago. I wonder what happened since then? Coincidence? I think not.

Unfortunately two of the main fires Eaton and Palisades are less than 50% contained. The Santa Ana winds are expected to increase again soon with the risk of more destruction. There are many organizations and companies that are opening their hearts and wallets to helping those affected. I personally know people who have lost everything and family members who were lucky to evade the fires so far. 

I am partnering with @vectorapparelprojects to secure donations for distribution in the LA area. If anyone wants information on where to donate or resources needed for those affected please send message in DM. 

We will get through this together!

The only people allowed through are emergency personnel, utility workers, and the press. Unfortunately, if you need to leave to get resources, you might not be allowed back in. This has been an issue for elderly residents, who with all of the confusion going on, are staying put. FEMA has been going in, which hopefully has been helpful. The National Guard I spoke with was friendly, having to deal with several concerned residents. LAPD on hand also had lots of helpful information and directions to receive resources.

Everyone I knew here has lost all they had I still can't wrap my head around it.

I was always here, either driving along Altadena Drive or visiting friends. My kids went to Woodbury Preschool Village (which has been spared) 

Whole lives full of memories, the beautiful surroundings, century old trees and incredible unreplicable architecture. Everything gone within hours.

Gregory Ain designed these 28 ""Park Planned Homes"" in 1948. Homes incorporating the collective spirit, good design that was supposed to be within reach for all. They are no longer...

Photos (first one) by Pam Remal and Dana Hursey

I'm worried about all the longtime residents who will not have the strength to rebuild and all the speculation that will follow and not include the original spirit of the neighborhood. But in the short term I am here, available to help in any way I can. 

If you or someone you know needs to talk, cry, find as new place. Please know I am available. I want the politicizing and ""divide and conquer"" politics of this country to stop here.

Our food donation events will be held every Wednesday at @unincorporatedcoffee Eagle Rock location, for as long as we have the funds for it.

In addition to the various fire fighting agencies from around the country that have responded to the Eaton Fire, there are so many more who never receive the recognition they deserve in these situations. 

After the fires are extinguished, the recovery work begins. 

Downed power lines need to be checked, de-energized and removed if causing obstructions. Power needs to be restored in areas that survived the fires to prepare for residents to return. 

Fallen trees need to be cleared to open up roads and access routes for search teams, as well as allowing clear safe routes for residents upon return. 

Natural gas lines need to be inspected to ensure there are no leaks or fires and addressed accordingly. 

Water service needs to be inspected to ensure those who can return will have access.

Animals and pets need to be recovered and cared for. 

Phone and internet service restoration will allow residents to return and maintain communication. 

These are just some of the agencies/organizations we have seen in the area working around the clock.

üí® Santa Ana winds are (still!) set to cause critical fire conditions over the next 3Ô∏è‚É£ days, as we continue to battle historic and deadly blazes. 

So we are NOT out of woods yet, pun intended.

The wind-fed wildfires have:

ü•∫Killed at least 24 people (as of now)
ü•∫Rendered another 16 missing (as of now)
ü•∫Burned 40,000 acres in the Greater LA area 
ü•∫Destroyed 12,300 structures and entire communities

Evacuation orders for the largest blaze, the Palisades Fire have expanded. 

üî• It is 14% contained and threatens Brentwood, Encino and Westwood.

Evacuation orders are currently in effect for 92,000 L.A. residents, and 89,000 are in evacuation warning zones, which means they may need to leave at a moment‚Äôs notice. At its height, 180,000 people were evacuated.

This is a BIG freakin‚Äô deal.

What‚Äôs positive? 

Well, there are so many people out there offering to help: 

üêé People with massive horse trailers who can transport up to 20 horses are offering to help. 

üê∂ Animal shelters everywhere are offering pet housing.

ü•ò Tons of evacuation centers and donation centers are everywhere in LA County. It isn‚Äôt hard to find a place to donate supplies, food, clothes, or money.

Quick online searches immediately turn up all of these resources. 

I‚Äôve made a commitment to contribute to everyone I know who sends me a GoFundMe page for a friend or family member to rebuild a home, and have done that several times. That feels good, so keep ‚Äòem coming.

Thank you to people like @cmart1010 @cruzbomb and @loaracadavona (who I know from high school, run club, and a community board) who have shared these fundraisers for their extremely close friends and siblings. 

If you‚Äôre wanting a place to donate, these are three great options and I can forward those pages to you. 

We must STAY STRONG, Los Angeles.

‚Ä®On Wednesday morning after we evacuated, our neighbor informed us that our (Max, Jasmine & Tim) home, as well as the entire neighborhood had been completely destroyed by the #EatonFire that started Tuesday night on 1/7‚Ä®‚Ä®On Thurs (1/9), our family was able to locate a back route to our home to see the devastations on our own. The worst was confirmed, everything is gone. ‚Ä®‚Ä®We are now thankful that we took the opportunity to do this, because the next day, National Guard arrived in Altadena blocking any route to our town. 

We feel strongly that we want to be in the #Altadena area for the time ahead so that we can access resources and be part of the community that we love. 

It is still so early in the process and we don‚Äôt know the ins and outs of the rebuilding process, so I will just express our desires. We want to rebuild on our home land. That dream is still intact. 

With the rebuild process we want to work with honest, hardworking people who will be fair and not look to price gouge us or our beloved community. 

Thank you to everyone who has already donated to our gofundme page. The support we have received since the fires broke out is incredibly humbling and overwhelming. One of our favorite movies is It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life, and we feel the love and generosity of our community just like George Bailey did at the end of the film. ‚Ä®‚Ä®We‚Äôve gotten so many messages, texts and calls, asking how they can help. Because we‚Äôre living out of our suitcases right now, we are living on only necessities, which have been covered. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Whatever you can give to our fund is extremely helpful and appreciated for unknown future expenses that won‚Äôt be covered by insurance or disaster relief (FEMA). Even if you can‚Äôt give, we‚Äôd appreciate all the eyes we can receive. ‚Ä®‚Ä®We love you all, and we feel that same love back at us!‚Ä®‚Ä®-Max, Jasmine, Tim and Charlie

I have seen so many posts in the last few days attacking Los Angeles, saying folks ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care if celebrities lose their homes,‚Äù things about North Carolina being more of a tragedy, etc.

Posts like this are really hurtful when we have thousands of very real people out here losing their homes. People just like you.

My sister works at a school and 52 of her students have lost their homes. I personally know at least a dozen who have lost everything and so many more who have been evacuated due to smoke and air quality.

The devastation of what we are dealing with here does not make North Carolina any less of a tragedy. Both can be suffering and both can need assistance. Asheville is still in shambles and we will be the same for months and years to come.

Please don‚Äôt let the media convince you that anyone‚Äôs suffering isn‚Äôt important. There has been devastation here, there, and everywhere that deserves our kindness and compassion. We are all human beings surviving on the same planet. Please treat each other as such.

Tragedy is not a competition.

Today as we mark one week and counting since the Palisades, Eaton, and countless other LA-based fires began ravaging our city, our hearts are especially with the thousands of educators headed back to their classrooms today to greet their students once again. 

The devastation of dozens of schools across LA being damaged or completely lost to the fires is of course heartbreaking. How those communities will rebuild, how long it will take, and what they will do in the meantime only covers the logistical questions. Schools are a safe haven for our children, a place of learning, growth, creativity, and fun - and to not have access to the school you called home because of a destructive disaster like this is just beyond words. 

But today, we are especially thinking of those schools who escaped the obvious char of the building, escaped the power lines toppling down, escaped water damage, and the buildings are still standing as they always have been. Today we're thinking of all of the other schools who look the same from the outside, yet the people on the inside are forever changed.  As so many of our Angelenos return to school and ""business as usual"", you know that it must be incredibly hard for everyone. 

Harder for parents to let go of morning hugs with their child. 
Harder for kids to skip and laugh as they cross the threshold. 
And so difficult for educators to unplug from their own worries, fears, thoughts, desire to watch the news 24/7, and be fully available to hold space for their entire school community. 

Educators are heroes, they are the link from home to school that bridge students' two worlds, give them love and enough reassurance to inspire them to thrive, and provide consistency and stability for children when the outside world seems like its crumbling. 

Thank you educators for all that you do for each and every one of us, each and every day.  You are such an important piece in all of our recovery and we are so thankful for your patience and love during these challenging times. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",2025-01-13 19:18:07+00:00

We  are safe for now & grateful that there aren‚Äôt any fires in our proximity. We are in the Critical Fire Risk zone with a Red Flag Warning. 

Unfortunately, the Santa Ana Winds have started again until Wednesday, with gusts of up to 70 mph. This means we could have a second wave of fires, and with these winds, it is almost impossible to control them. 

My heart is heavy and broken for everyone affected by this ongoing tragedy, especially for our friends and colleagues who have lost everything or are close to those fires. When we received the evacuation warning at our office, we were able to successfully save all its contents for Dr. Marashi. He was one of the people who lost everything in the Pacific Palisades fire on Tuesday night. My heart breaks for the loss of Dr. Aubert‚Äôs home in Altadena during the Eaton fire. 

Diego has been working tirelessly at the command post, managing the logistics of the hospital and satellite cancer clinics to ensure patient safety, treatment, and the well-being of the staff. Over 30 of them have not only lost everything in their homes but also one lost her spouse, and a nurse actually coded. He has been up at 2am working every day since the fires started last Tuesday. 

Please keep LA in your prayers and send good thoughts to all of the people who have been displaced, lost loved ones, pets, and the wildlife who have also lost their habitats. May the 2nd wave we are preparing for be a mere drill and may we all remain strong and resilient and safe.

The quickest and easiest way to help? Make a donation - a financial donation goes farther, faster and can directly help those in need, both now and in the days and weeks to come. You can also help by signing up to volunteer and donating blood or platelets. Winter weather and disasters impact blood drives nationwide, but patients still need blood every day. You can learn more by visiting the Red Cross website at redcross.org.

Want to donate items like clothing? Great! Call 2-1-1 to connect with organizations that specialize in this work. The Red Cross is unable accept these items but other partners can. Our focus is keeping evacuees sheltered, fed and safe, but other partner agencies are focused on collecting, sorting and distributing much-needed items like clothing, shoes and other essentials.

What we need is environmentalism driven by science and practical solutions, not activism disconnected from reality.

üí™Most of us are horrified by the reprehensible, downright disgusting feedback we are getting from the other corners of our country . . . Some openly celebrating our devastating losses‚Ä¶ 

‚ú®But the GREATEST FORCE IN LIFE has always been about getting back up, and rising from the ashes.‚ú®

‚ú®Life  isn‚Äôt about what happens to you, life is about how you respond to what happens to you‚ú®

üëâAnd it‚Äôs now time to respond with love, with compassion, with equanimity to our fellow survivors, and to those who don‚Äôt know any better.

AN UNPOPULAR OPINION: The celebrities who‚Äôve lost their homes . . . have been evacuated, have also lost their hard earned money, their family photos and their safety and security. YES . . . they have the money to rebuild.
But right now, they also deserve our love and support. They‚Äôre also just as traumatized as everyone else.

There are idiots out her claiming that insurance will reimburse for housing, cleaning fees, etc. But that may be contingent on paying your deductible first. Total loss deductibles are in the thousands of dollars. In context, if you spend $10k and your deductible is $30k, there is no reimbursement.

Despite living in Washington for the past five years, John and I still consider Los Angeles home. We were there last week. We drove through what felt like the end times to get to Palm Desert. All I can do is text all of my friends all day and night to make sure they are ok. Of course, no one is ok. Not one person is ok. Most of them have been evacuated. Some multiple times from multiple locations across the city. Some friends have lost everything. 

They are all traumatized. And the worst may still be to come. 

So many people in this country love to hate on Los Angeles and California as a whole. The shadenfreude is revolting, but real. I beg of you. Remember these are human beings who need love, compassion, and yes, money and support. Most people who live in L.A. are NOT rich. The entertainment industry that many enjoy, but also love to vilify, is made up of people who are just trying to pay their bills and take care of their families. And this industry was decimated long before the fires. Many of my friends have been without work for two years! Two of my friends from the industry were being evicted from their painfully expensive small apartments because there has been no work. 

And now this. Please be kind and show only compassion. Please don‚Äôt get caught up in a tragedy that is already being politicized‚Äîwhere people‚Äôs suffering is being ridiculed by the cruel human who was unimaginably elected into office. This is all insult to injury. I beg of you not to get on that bandwagon. It only shows weak character. 

I ask that you don‚Äôt fall prey to cruelty. And, whatever you do, don‚Äôt ever tell me that you hate my home because I could never do that to you. 

My heart is broken. üíî

Dear friends, family, and our California community,

One of my closest friends, Jenny Martinez, and her family have tragically lost everything in the devastating Southern California fires, specifically the #EatonFire in Altadena.

Jenny has dedicated the past seven years to serving our community as a Senior Office Assistant in the Pasadena Fire Department‚Äôs Prevention Bureau. Year-round, she works tirelessly to ensure fire safety and prevention throughout Pasadena. Now, she finds herself on the other side of this tragedy, as her home and everything she owned have been destroyed.

Jenny and her family are in urgent need of support to begin rebuilding their lives. Every contribution, no matter the size, will make a difference in helping them recover from this heartbreaking loss.

Please consider donating to support Jenny and her family during this challenging time. Your generosity and kindness mean the world to them.

Thank you for your compassion and support.

The small things, the ordinary moments‚Äîthey were everything. And now, they‚Äôre gone.

But this community‚Äîthe Palisades kids, the parents, the neighbors who always looked out for each other‚Äîwas never just about the places. It‚Äôs about the people. And together, we‚Äôll mourn, and then, hand in hand, rebuild.

To this day, the Palisades fire is less than 15% contained and closely behind, the Eaton fire is at 27%, with a an overall death toll climbing to 24, and has swept through 40,000 acres. And Santa Ana winds are set to cause more critical fire conditions in the next few days.

I am grateful to be safe about 20 miles south of the Palisades fire, but the same can't be said for over 92,000 evacuated Los Angeles residents. People think of L.A. and for some reason they think everyone is wealthy or a celebrity. This couldn't be further from the truth. Families of ALL economic backgrounds have lost everything.

As I said before, I will be donating 100% of my profits to @coreresponse, who is actively responding to this disaster by focusing on short and long term recovery, especially for underserved communities.

At DeMera DeMera Cameron, LLP, we stand with those affected by the ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles County. During these challenging times, it‚Äôs essential to prioritize safety and know that resources are available to help.

üí° Tax Tip for Wildfire Victims:
The IRS has extended the tax filing and payment deadlines for individuals and businesses in Los Angeles County and other FEMA-designated areas. Affected taxpayers now have until October 15, 2025, to file federal returns and make payments for deadlines originally falling between January 7 and October 15, 2025.

üëâ Uninsured or unreimbursed disaster-related losses can also be claimed on your 2024 or 2025 tax return. Don‚Äôt forget to write the FEMA declaration number 4856-DR on your return if claiming a loss.

For details on tax relief, visit the IRS‚Äôs Disaster Assistance page or contact our team for guidance.

üíõ Stay safe, Los Angeles. We‚Äôre here to help.

When I got out of the car, I noticed a faint glow in the San Gabriel Foothills to the northeast. This was concerning because it was nowhere near the fire raging at the coast. The glow began to expand and I set up my tripod in the strong wind to try to capture what was happening. Many of the long exposures are blurry because of the conditions, but I have a number of frames that are sharp. I captured the very beginning of Eaton Fire which would go on to destroy nearly all of Altadena. The second photo was taken roughly 15 minutes after the first, so you can see how quickly the fire took off. 

I apologize for the recent number of fire pictures, but it is LA history now. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be sharing more joyful content again soon.

We are thinking of everyone affected by the fires and send love and appreciation to each and every one of you.

Sadly, our beloved city, where many of us were born and raised, has faced wildfires before. We remember the Woolsey Fire in Malibu (2018) and the Getty Fire in Brentwood (2019). While the current fires are more severe, the heartbreak of losing a home remains the same.

We were there for people previously affected, and we are here for you now. 

If you decide to move forward with rebuilding, here are the essential steps to take:
- Start the Process Early: Begin as soon as possible to avoid delays.
- Gather Property Records: Locate existing plans of the damaged property or contact LADBS to obtain official records.
- Create a Loss Inventory: Make a detailed list of belongings lost in the fire.
- Collect Pre-Fire Photos: Gather any photos of the property‚Äôs exterior and interior taken before the fire for insurance purposes.
- Stay Informed:  Keep up with local and state regulations regarding insurance claims, debris removal, and rebuilding requirements.

We can assist you with any of these steps and provide guidance specific to your situation.

Please give us a FREE call at 323-938-1960, email shannon@citizenproperties.com or visit our website if you need support and have any questions about:

 - Insurance
 - Owner‚Äôs Rep
 - Debris Removal
 - Permitting and City records
 - Design/Build

We are here for you!

Love and blessings,
Team CPI

‚Å†
Stu and Charlie grew up in Santa Monica and have watched the fires raging in Los Angeles with sadness and of course, a special sense of knowing those neighborhoods now being ravaged.‚Å†
‚Å†
We are sending our best wishes for recovery and safety to everyone suffering through these fires.‚Å†
‚Å†
So many want to help but don't know where to start, here's an idea: during the Glass Fire in 2020 we relied heavily on Watch Duty, a free app, which alerts you to wildfires and firefighting taking place near your location in real time. Again, we can‚Äôt underestimate what an amazing service and resource Watch Duty was for us.‚Å†
‚Å†
It‚Äôs a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, founded in Sonoma County. It is now a great resource for everyone in Los Angeles as the fires there continue to rage.‚Å†
There are now 7 million users of the app and in one 24-hour period this past week more than a million people downloaded the app.‚Å†
‚Å†
May we suggest that you consider donating? That will help Watch Duty continue to help anyone in need of up-to-date information about fires.‚Å†

We are only allowed to feature four items at a time, but as they hopefully sell, we will add new items. In addition, if LA stuff is not your thing, we are also including 20% of all sales in January.

I wrote this brief list of tips and recommendations for framing disaster mental health responses for my fellow clinicians and providers out there. 

You are a great resource for our Angelenos as we continue in this response phase. Be kind to yourself right now. Burnout is high already in our field, and then gets majorly amplified during times of natural and man-made disasters. Keep putting your oxygen mask on first. Then check in with your loved ones, family members, friends, and CLIENTs. Focus on immediate basic needs.

Active grief and all its forms is a normal reaction to the current situation. People‚Äôs lives and communities have forever been changed. And this is raw, visceral, and often unverbalized. Comfort one another. Check in on each other. Thank each other for help. LA will process these collective and individual losses more deeply as we shift from one disaster and emotional phase to another. When the shock wears off...therapists, counselors, social workers, doctors, nurses, vetmed/animal med staff, medical professionals, teachers, and coaches will be ready to provide more support.

This is a starting point for additional mental health and psychosocial services supported during a disaster.

Be kind and keep hope.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Work with an Expert: Consider working with an experienced insurance agent who knows the market and can advocate for you.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check Admitted Insurers: Look for policies from admitted insurance companies that comply with state regulations.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid Being Underinsured: Review your policy to ensure your coverage reflects your property‚Äôs actual value and replacement cost.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Compare Coverage Options: Take the time to evaluate different types of coverage and policy limits to ensure you‚Äôre getting the best fit.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Surplus Lines: If traditional insurers won‚Äôt cover you, surplus lines insurance may offer another solution.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Use the FAIR Plan as a Last Resort: This state-backed plan is available when no other options remain, but only covers certain losses by fire and smoke. You can contact them at 800-339-4099

I remember gasping when I looked out my window on Tuesday morning and saw a huge plume of smoke nearby. I never imagined the scale of destruction and loss that would unfold over the next 48 hours. Nobody did.

As devastating as these fires have been, it‚Äôs also been heartwarming to see our local community and organizations coming together to help support those who have suffered tremendous loss.

If you feel inclined to donate, below are some organizations helping to support and rebuild:

@mutualaidla
supportlafd.org
enla.org
laworks.com/2025fires
@baby2baby
@pasadenahumane
@itsbiggerthanus_
@heartsinactionla

There are also hundreds if not thousands of GoFundMe pages for individuals and families needing support.

And huge shout out to @watchdutyapp a non-profit that‚Äôs been providing real time fire updates and evacuation orders. They‚Äôve been a lifeline to so many of us in Los Angeles (and they also accept donations).

I‚Äôm deeply grateful our place in Santa Monica has been safe and my heart goes out to everyone that has been deeply affected by these fires.

In light of the recent devastation caused by the fires affecting our beloved city, our friends at Hollywood Prayer Network invites you to a special night of prayer, community, and encouragement this Thursday January 16th at 6:30pm at First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood. Let‚Äôs come together to support one another, share comfort, and uplift our spirits with prayer, worship, and fellowship in these challenging times.

This gathering will be a chance to connect and to seek strength and hope through prayer, worship, collecting needed items for victims, and giving to those in need. A list of items needed for the RedCross will be emailed out before the event.

Together, we can be a source of light and strength for each other and for our community. Now is the time to gather, find healing for discouragement, and stand united. We hope to see you there!

Despite the news and city officials saying otherwise, the national guard and CHP officers REFUSED TO ALLOW US TO PASS OFF SUPPLIES TO OUR NEIGHBORS.  They stood between us and said that no one above the evacuation line was allowed to receive aid from anyone outside of the evacuation line.  I was delivering cat food for my stray cats, water, and phone charging banks.  The officer looked at my neighbor and said ‚Äúhe has enough.‚Äù WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS DISASTER!?!?!? Communication is non existent.  Messaging changes every minute.  And they are now trying to STARVE OUT HUMANS who have nowhere to go and who risked their lives to defend their property while the city was helpless.

Sadly, the Eaton fire has burnt down much of the volunteer built infrastructure associated with the site, including a shelter and signage. The fire has also claimed friends' homes in the community below the mountains. I am so thankful for the kindness of folks in Altadena and Pasadena - my dissertation wouldn't have happened without their help and support. It is an absolute tragedy.

With everything moving so fast this week, we‚Äôve had little time to pause or chat. We‚Äôve worked alongside so many like-minded individuals, so fast, in fact, that we may never see each other again. We might not even remember each other‚Äôs names or faces, but we‚Äôll definitely remember everything we accomplished during this second week of 2025. A huge thank-you to @katcabula for bringing snacks and for the heartwarming card üôåüèΩ

Stay tuned for more relief efforts from Esquina. We‚Äôre not done helping. This is what Esquina is all about. We love LA and will continue to give back-LA strong, por vida.

At the same time, we‚Äôre NOW feeling the financial strain of this crisis and have to split some of our focus to be there for our own team. With fewer riders on the streets and uncertainty in the air, our daily earnings have dropped significantly, making it harder to keep the shop running. We‚Äôve started a GoFundMe to help cover rent, staff wages, and operational costs during this tough time.

Please consider donating or sharing our GoFundMe link (in bio). Every contribution, big or small, helps keep Esquina alive and ensures we can continue to be a space for connection, support, and joy.

In 2020 we saw the most devastating fires in California‚Äôs history and we rallied as a community by visiting base camps and writing notes of gratitude to the men and women protecting us.  Now in 2025, we are called to do so again.  However, finding effective ways to support and show appreciation for our firefighters and their families can be hard.  So Diablo is supporting with donations to smaller, direct-impact, vetted and First Responder recommended charities.

All proceeds will be given in the name of our community and divided among several including - the Gary Sinise Foundation‚Äôs disaster relief emergency fund for LA, The Overwatch Collective: a Bay Area foundation providing resources for ongoing mental health and awareness, First Responder Therapy Dogs: a locally based therapy dog foundation on-site in LA, a smaller Northern California Firefighter organization bringing aid to them on the front lines and support for their families at home.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday issued an executive order to fast-track the debris removal from the scarred areas. The two fires have consumed nearly 40,000 acres and destroyed or damaged 12,000 structures.

Once bustling streets have been reduced to piles of blackened debris for blocks, prompting concern  about hazardous materials and other debris from the burned properties, and the impact if winter storms bring rainfall to the areas.

‚ÄúRemoving the debris generated by these devastating fires, with thousands of destroyed or damaged structures located in disparate parts of Los Angeles County, presents a monumental challenge,‚Äù Newsom‚Äôs executive order said.

If not dealt with quickly, according to the governor, it could result in damaging debris flows, mudslides and flash floods that could harm surrounding communities.

Eaton Fire - January 2025
Altadena, CA

Half of my life was growing up in this town.  I attended kindergarten, elementary, middle school, junior high and high school in Altadena.  As a kid, I rode my bike everywhere with friends and we found every shortcut, vacant lot and spot to jump our bikes. From Eaton Canyon to Oak Grove, to the eateries of Washington Blvd and scenic views of Echo Mountain.  There wasn‚Äôt a place we didn‚Äôt explore.  Over the years, my friends would get married in the various churches around town and host receptions in the backyards of family.  Later buying homes and starting families of their own.  Many remained local, continuing the Dena legacy, while others moved on.  I, for one, followed my career down south but remain somewhat attached to the city.  My parents still reside and were recently evacuated, their house still remains (at last check), but we grieve for those who‚Äôve lost everything.  The photos I‚Äôve shared over the past week were not to chase likes or followers, but simply to share the current landscape with those both familiar and unfamiliar - guess it‚Äôs also my coping mechanism, my outlet.  I plan to return again soon, with camera, to document the rebuilding of this unique town and the resilience of its people.  For those who‚Äôve made it this far, thanks for listening. ‚úåÔ∏è

Thank you to all of the volunteers and donors who‚Äôve put their lives on hold to help aid our friends in need during their darkest hour. You are all true heroes and the city will be forever grateful for your efforts. 

As the world changes, the threat of fast spreading fires becomes greater and we need to ensure our firefighters have the equipment they need to protect us. Wildfires are not our only concern. Fires in urban developments are inevitable and we‚Äôve all just witnessed the destruction they can cause. Please donate anything you can to help support the LAFD. They need our help so they can protect us when we need their help. If you are in a position to give more, please also consider making a donation to the California Fire Foundation. 

Lastly, if anyone still has animals left behind please dm me and I will do everything in my power to try get your babies to safety ü§ç

I know that the forest will regrow. I know that after the fire, a balance of flora and fauna will be restored. I know that once the smoke settles, wildlife vitality will improve because plants once overshadowed by looming trees will have a chance to thrive.  Regeneration will come after the grief. But for now, I am still grieving. First and foremost, my heart is with those who have lost family members in these fires. I am heartbroken for the countless people who have lost their homes in this disaster. So many people lost everything they own and their lives will never be the same. My heart also breaks for those whose home is the Angeles National Forest. I know many of us find our peace and our solice in these canyons and on these peaks. Surviving in Los Angeles requires a particular level of strength and practicing a certain level of self-care. I know that for many of us, a drive up the 2 or an escape to a waterfall is what we use to ground us and to grow us. I'm probably not the only one who feels more at home in these mountains than they do in their own apartment. At this time, I also think about the animals that live here who have done nothing to contribute to climate change but continue to be endangered and displaced. I know that we will regrow & rebuild, but I also know that things will never be or look the same. Pulling out 20 great memories from the vault, pictures taken on land that has already burned in the #palisadesfire and the #eatonfire, the 1st and 2nd most destructive fires in California State history. We are currently on Day 6 of these fires and neither fire is even 50% contained. We have to do better. I know we will rebuild. But I also hope that we will take on an increased responsibility in land management. üíîüíöüíô

9358,altadena,lafires,eatonfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DEyu1AUxL1_/,215266454,Altadena,"The day the Eaton Fire ignited we had woken up to our thick wooden gate having been torn from its hinges by the wind. Debris was every where and it had pulled fruit trees from the ground. 

At 4pm we lost power and around 6pm we decided to head to dinner at Pie n Burger. The winds pushed our car as we drove and rattled the windows of the restaurant once we got there. It continued to blow and with enough force to rip the door open. 

At the end of our meal my grandma called us to say that Eaton Canyon was on fire and in the same time it took to google it it came up on the news in the diner. We were 4 miles away from home and our dog Fernando and 2 cats Beans and Paloma were inside. 

We raced back up the hill straight into the fire. Cars were streaming back down the hill and at one point I thought they might not let us through to save them. 

We could see the fire right over the tree line the bright orange drawing towards us with every minute. We grabbed the animals and packed the cars as fast as possible. I drove alone in the darkness with fire at my back, two screaming cats, and hurricane force winds pushing my small car and sending branches flying.

We evacuated to my grandpas house in el serno and watched all night long as our neighborhood burned. At 6am a neighbor called and asked for our help we were ‚Äútwo blocks from annihilation‚Äù so my dad and I decided to go back to defend the house. 

When we got to the house we could see the flames coming from the front yard. We immediately go to work clearing the brush, pulling explosive materials away from the house, and wetting it down. I cut down anything that might be touching the house. We worked hard to prep the yard if the worst case scenario was to unfold. 

At 2pm we were finally able to walk up and see the actual damage the fires had caused to our neighborhood. Our house and our block survived because a small group of neighbors stayed behind to defend our houses. They used buckets of water and small fire extinguishers to keep the fire back.

The last side is where one neighbor alone fought a fire that had engulfed the gate and bushes of a house one block up. He saved Pasadena. #altadena #lafires #eatonfire",2025-01-14 04:31:29+00:00

Tonight I want to highlight Altadena, a city that is very much in my heart.  Before moving out of LA 2 years ago we called the Pasadena area home. Back in 2018, we came very close to moving to Altadena.  We were drawn to the stunning historic homes, the diverse community, the bohemian vibe, and the wonderful neighborhoods. Last night my husband and I were looking at the area of devastation and we realized that every one of the homes we looked at were gone.  Including the one in this photo that we came closest to making an offer on and think about often.  It was built in 1915. 

I can‚Äôt begin to express the sorrow for the families affected by this fire.  Most homeowners in Altadena include young families that have invested everything they have, elderly families who raised their children in their homes where they have lived for 50+ years, and a thriving black community that has been there for generations and truly made Altadena what it is today. 

In this post, I‚Äôve highlighted some of these families that have lost everything. They are all families that I know personally, or are friends of friends.  There are so many people who have been impacted by this tragedy, but tonight I wanted to share some personal connections. 

Go to the link in my profile to give to the @gofundme pages of not only the families highlighted here, but also some I know that were impacted by the Palisades fire. 

Thank you to @keelerliz @mary_terterov @eonvaulter @lilliankang1 @iamgiselelima @itisnttoolate @octaviaklein_ for helping me to highlight these wonderful families.

Day 1 of 3

It‚Äôs been 6 days since the #eatonfire has erupted. Since lives have completely changed. You never think something like this will happen to a community you love. A community where your sister and her family lives. A community where I started a family of four. A community you spend almost everyday in.

These next 3 series of posts is my letter. A form of expression through art. Through storytelling. To my old neighbors. My friends. To those who lost their homes. To the ones still in tact with battle scares. To the businesses I love and lost. To the ones I love still standing. To Harriet St. Janes Village. To Altadena from east to west. It‚Äôs all beautiful in its own way.

This post is a timeline. Pretty much in chronological order from my experience. It starts out with the conversation I had with my sister when I found out there was a fire in Altadena shortly after 6pm.

The perfect storm was brewing and nobody knew to the extent of what was about to unfold.

What isn‚Äôt being discussed amongst the hideous things being thrown around in our political sphere is that many African-American families in Altadena are losing the opportunity to pass down generational wealth in the loss of these homes.

(The link is in my profile.)

Luckily, @nasajpl is safe, thanks to the heroic efforts of firefighters as well as some natural advantages of the site in the Arroyo Seco. But as you can see in the map image here, the Eaton Fire crept right up to JPL's doors. The boundary is represented by the red dotted line.

The space program, and especially JPL, has had a massive influence on storytellers. Science fiction would not be what it is without this facility, and as a kid I always was thrilled by any opportunity to visit. (They do very cool events for kids and schools.) Getting to party with literal rocket scientists who knew how to build space robots is exactly as amazing as you think.

The most recent work of fiction to hit it big which features JPL was The Martian by Andy Weir. This book was completely accurate in its description of the creativity, dedication, and hard work that JPLers put into everything they do. And while their lab is safe, unfortunately more than 150 of them have lost their homes and quite a lot more have been evacuated with no idea of when they'll be able to go home or what will remain there. There's a fundraiser for them, so if you are a fan of the many, many stories inspired by JPL, please consider donating.

We have been housing families that lost everything in the Eaton Fire. So many of my projects were destroyed and burned down in the #PalisadesFire and #EatonFire.  So much energy spent paying attention to architectural details and Tracking purchases now gone. 
The real lesson this disaster has taught me is that stuff is temporary that we only rent  while here on Earth. 
A very wise man said to me when I was going through a difficult time and felt overwhelmed trying to solve my problem. He said ‚ÄòNothing is a true problem if it can be solved with money‚ÄùI have taken this philosophy to heart and put it to use daily. 
We wil rebuild ,estimated cost of half a trillion dollars, and money can solve this. What was also destroyed was the entire lifestyle of my fellow Angelenos.  they won‚Äôt be able to wave hello to their neighbors of 40+ years as they pull out of their driveway. They won‚Äôt be able to meet friends at their ‚Äòplace‚Äô because it burned to the ground. No chance to visit their Alma Mater or say goodbye to the dry cleaning lady. These are problems that can‚Äôt be solved with money. These relationships , 
which are the heart blood of daily life, will take years to rebuild and with an entirely new cast of characters. 

The pulse of the city died and that is difficult to restart or count in numbers instead It is counted in years lived not dollars spent. 
This has reminded me to treasure all of the people around me and be thankful no more lives were lost.  I‚Äôm so grateful to be safe in my  home with my Family around me 
But our lifestyle will change forever.",2025-01-14 14:01:27+00:00

Ryan Grothe at McClellan-Palomar Airport has spent his career responding to emergencies, but his recent journey to document the Palisades Fire in Los Angeles left him awestruck by the sheer scale of destruction.

Grothe, a part-time freelance photographer, traveled north before sunrise on Jan. 9, navigating roadblocks and treacherous conditions to capture the wreckage from wildfires still rampaging across Los Angeles County.

""It looked like a bomb went off,"" Grothe said. ""Power lines snapped in half, street lights knocked over, burned out cars ‚Äî (the fire) destroyed everything in its path in Pacific Palisades.""

They fought the blaze for the first 48 hours straight without sleeping before finally getting relieved Thursday when reinforcements arrived.

Here‚Äôs what I learned after visiting a couple of fire stations in Pasadena yesterday: They don‚Äôt actually need anything. At this point, they‚Äôre fully supplied. Unless you want to do what we did and bring them a couple dozen donuts as a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô, or some cases of Waterloo sparkling water, which they told us they refer to as ‚ÄúStation Beer‚Äù. (Awesome)

A few minutes after we arrived they got called back out, not to the Eaton Fire, but to an unrelated emergency. ( It‚Äôs well to remember that those are also still happening in the midst of all this.) Just as we were about to drive away, they walked out and said the call was canceled, and asked if we‚Äôd like a tour of the station. We went back inside and I snapped a few photos as we talked with them and they showed us around.

These are some of the nicest, bravest, most humble men you could ever meet. Holloway there, in the 4th photo, has been at this station for 45 years and has some crazy stories.

More on Station 36 soon. I jokingly asked if they had a suit tiny enough to fit me so that I could tag along, and they actually invited me to ride along with them this weekend and bring my camera. So, obviously, I‚Äôm doing that. 

Til then, there‚Äôs a new evacuation relief center that just opened at 930 Mateo St downtown. If you‚Äôre in DTLA and looking for a way to help, they need volunteers. I plan to be there throughout the week.

Having now seen the enormity of the Santa Anita Racetrack operation last night, I suggest dropping any large donations off there. 

Stay tuned. I‚Äôll do my best to share updates and advice on these operations and what they need as I find them. Helps everyone wrap their head around how best to help and where to go.

My family is safe. My sister and her family, my Mom and Dad, all safe. 

The outpouring of support and affirmation from friends distant and near - even here on IG! - has been felt and has been so dear. Voices from the past that I have not heard from in years. Voices of those I had no idea had an Altadena connection and yet, like me, have experienced this calamity in a personal way. 

Thank you. From my heart, thank you üôèüèº

There is much to tell and I find I can say next to nothing. Yesterday was the first day in over three weeks I had to myself and I'd set aside time to journal about the calamity that has befallen Altadena - the place of my rearing and my parents' place of residence for nearly forty years up until last Wed. I managed exactly two sentences. I sat in my own quiet home, weeping, before putting on my big boy pants (and lots of PPE) to get outside and clear the debris from last week. Highland Park is under a blanket of leaves and bracken, dust and toxic ash from days worth of smoke blowing straight off the mountain and into our face. 

This is a photo I didn't think much of when I took it two years ago. In an instant it is imbued with meaning and aching longing for all that's been lost.

It's a bridge in Eaton Canyon I've crossed over dozens of times in my life. We used to ride our bikes to this spot from my parents' house. Someone posted a video of it, and the railing is completely burned away to say nothing of the vegetation.

No amount of philosophizing or sermonizing can make this alright or diminish the aching in my heart or that of my fellow Angelenos in this time. I just want to say - take the pic. Don't just drive past that spot again. Pull over. Fix your lens on your house, your kids, your mom. Give them a hug and a kiss after you click.

And THANK YOU to everyone that volunteered their time to come help pack, & also assist with the deliveries!!‚ù§Ô∏èüôå

The first set for lunch on Sunday, Thankfully through @u_getz contact, was taken to the Fire Dept Headquarters for all the different departments that were located in there, for everyone that‚Äôs behind the scenes along with front liners that go in and out. They are working LONG hours and are often forgotten, so for us to deliver them their meals, meant the WORLD to them.
The constant Gratitude they had, the continuous thanks they kept giving us.. Us?! No, WE should be thanking YOU. 
(We were all so excited and grateful ourselves I forgot to ask for a picture with those beautiful faces for the memories)

Then from there, and thankfully through my friend who is a Sergeant with the Sheriffs Dept, we were able to deliver to the Emergency Operations Bureau to his old partner who is now the lead Sergeant of the whole Department, where the heads of every single Department / Agency you could think of that‚Äôs involved were working out of.. They delegate absolutely EVERYTHING for anything that is needed, any time, any place, whatever it may be, from A-Z. Without them, the brain, either none of this would happen/be possible, or it would all be utter chaos. Often forgotten, but also doing the absolute most and working through exhaustion, full days even up to 24 Hrs. 
The lead Sergeant brought us in the command room, to deliver the meals where they all were, & he took a moment to stop everyone in the middle of their work, to let everyone know that we were delivering food for them..
They too, were Grateful beyond words.. Constant thanks and smiles, and stunned faces.. But in reality, who are We..? YOU guys are the ones doing all this incredible work, We thank Each & Every One of You. 

As they had sensitive information up on the screens, I got to have a few of these amazing people come in the other room to snap a photo (with the Lead Sgt behind the camera taking the pic)

While my heart absolutely breaks for all the people who have lost everything, it breaks even more for all the animals displaced, abandoned, and with nowhere to go. Many evacuation orders happened during the day while people were at work and their pets were left behind as they weren‚Äôt allowed back into their neighborhoods. Wildlife narrowly escaped the forests that became engulfed in flames. Large animals like the horses pictured above had few options for transport to safety. The one silver lining is all of the organizations and people that have banded together to save as many animals as possible. It‚Äôs amazing how tragedy can bring people together despite everything.

All profit from the sales of these hats and totes will be going directly to help people from Altadena recover and rebuild from the fire. We‚Äôve been focusing our efforts on hand delivering supplies directly to our displaced neighbours, taking on community requests, and supporting people financially. 

Full transparency we are getting these hats and totes printed to order in the USA! Since we have been displaced we do not have a permanent space which we can ship larger things from so we are getting them printed to order and shipped to you.

Here is the pricing breakdown per hat and tote to show cost and how much will be donated:

HATS: Item cost $14.59 + shipping $4.39 = $18.98 cost to produce. $30 - $18.98 = $11.02 profit to be donated

TOTE BAGS: Item cost $14.15 + shipping $4.39 = $18.54 cost to produce. $25 - $18.54 = $6.46 profit to be donated

Tune into our live sale today, Tuesday 1/14 and Friday 1/17 here on Instagram at 3PM PST where we will be sharing new pieces and some restocks y‚Äôall have been begging us to make! 

We know people want to help those who have lost so much already here in LA. We want to be transparent with our efforts and where we are donating and causes we are actively supporting. There have been massive amounts of clothing being donated to various sites across LA. Many have stopped taking clothing or have very specific items they are looking for as it‚Äôs become overwhelming sorting what is good vs. people‚Äôs trash. We‚Äôve been in communication with several underwear brands who are excited to participate in our ‚ÄúPanty Party‚Äù where we will distribute underwear and bras to various sites across LA for this impacted by these fires in an array of sizes. We are also hoping to purchase at least 10 industrial grade rolling z-racks this week (the goal is ALL 30) to provide to @shopquirkla to aid with their free store providing clothing and necessities! 

When their infrastructure is more in place with z-racks, hangers and displays; we will rally our community to let them know exactly what is needed to serve our city with specific donations.

We know people want to help by donating their used clothing but, what is needed most at many of these sites is INFRASTRUCTURE to sort and display. On Sunday, multiple garment racks broke under the weight of the clothing! IT‚ÄôS SO DEFEATING trying to do this work and help others when the racks snap and have to be trashed! 

If you have any of the infrastructure items needed or want to purchase them, we‚Äôve included the wishlist for @shopquirkla and are happy to run things over to them if it is easier to bring to byVINNIK! They are doing the GOOD WORK and we are so happy we can all help our friends, family, neighbors and strangers who are part of the vibrant LA community üî•

Thank you for stopping to read this. As some may know, my 21st birthday is nearing. I wanted to go back to my hometown and celebrate the city that I feel so much love and connection to for my birthday. It‚Äôs devisating to know that I will be visiting during a time of such tragedy and heartbreak due to the fires that have broken out in the cities neighboring the town where I spent some of the best years of my life. 

For my birthday, I beg of you to not send me any presents. The greatest gift you all could give me would be to donate to the California Fire Foundation to help support the brave men and women risking their lives on the front lines, and for the recovery for the thousands of victims that have lost their homes and their families to these horrific fires. 

To all my friends in the city of angels, it was named that for a reason. The strength of that city will not let you down. I send my heart, blessings, and as much donation as I can to the victims of these fires. Thank you all ‚ù§Ô∏è

Some of my favorite moments for small joys and peace were taking in our 'Altadena' sunsets each night - the photo below is from my backyard which captures the first sunset of 2025 -- my house, like many of yours is gone.
I also loved walking around Altadena to enjoy the beauty of my neighbors' homes and landscaping - the photo below captures a buddha I discovered bathed in sunlight on Sunny Oaks Circle. I don't know if the buddha on sunny oaks circle is still there but I will think about and cherish all the memories of our homes, -- with their unique and splendid personalities.¬†

@curation_records is doing a 100% match on all purchases and donating the money to charities to help people in this heartbreaking and stressful time.

So there is no better time to throw some money their way. Picking up some great tunes and helping some people out at the same time sounds like a win-win to me.

If you are looking for recommendations, I highly recommend GospelBeach‚Äôs ‚ÄúWiggle Your Fingers‚Äù, The Beachwood Sparks ‚ÄúAcross The River of Stars‚Äù ,‚Äù Stewart Forgey‚Äôs ‚ÄúNature of the Universe‚Äú, The Evening Sons ‚ÄúTracks,or Luther Russell‚Äôs new record ‚ÄúHappiness For Beginners,‚Äú but honestly you could close your eyes and point and land on a killer record from this label.

I just picked up @silver.synthetic new Album, CD, and t-shirt bundle. The first single, ‚ÄúYr Gonna Be Happy,‚Äù sounds like a more jangly, cosmic power pop version of Loaded era Velvet Underground and 80‚Äôs Dead! I‚Äôm all in!

We all know that the powers that be don‚Äôt care all that much about us, so in the end, all we have in times like these is each other, so if you can help in some way, do it. Even doing a little can turn into a big thing and make a difference.

Spread the word, spread the money and spread the love.

Los Angeles has faced incredible challenges, and the outpouring of support has been truly inspiring.

Volunteers have provided food, shelter, and emotional support to evacuees. Firefighters from Northern California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Canada, and Mexico have joined forces, sending crews and resources to protect our communities.

Horse owners and animal lovers have come together to evacuate animals, ensuring their safety when it matters most. Rescue teams, volunteers, and neighbors have shown courage and compassion every step of the way.

This city‚Äôs strength lies in its people‚Äîand in those who come from afar to help. Together, we prove that kindness and unity will always prevail.

One of my favourite places in Altadena also seems particularly prescient right now. 

At the top of Echo Mountain, via the Sam Merrill trail, sit the ruins of the hotel and mountain railroad, part of a Victorian resort named White City, built by Thaddeus Lowe in 1893 above Altadena.

From its grand opening through to its eventual abandonment in 1936, fire and wind ravaged the resort several times, but they continued to rebuild. 

Today, standing up there among the ruins feels simultaneously inspiring and cautionary. It would be understatement to say I can't wait to get back up there again soon.

A Rainbow Above the Flames

Amidst the hills where fires roar,
And ash falls soft on the city floor,
Los Angeles stands, fierce and true,
Hope gleaming bright in skies of blue.

The winds may howl, the embers fly,
But courage rises, reaching the sky.
Firefighters brave, with hearts of steel,
Battling the blaze, their wounds to heal.

Above the chaos, a rainbow appears,
A bridge of hope through smoke and tears.
The air-tankers soar, a dance in the air,
Graceful and bold, with strength so rare.

Pilots weaving through the fiery haze,
Defying odds, their spirits ablaze.
With every drop, the flames they tame,
Heroes unknown, yet earned their name.

Through the trials, the city stands tall,
A testament to the courage of all.
The fires may scorch, but life renews,
Los Angeles, bathed in radiant hues.

So look to the rainbow, let hope take flight,
Through darkest days, there comes the light.
Together we rise, together we strive,
In the heart of the flames, we keep dreams alive.-VFP

The people of Los Angeles and all of Southern California have truly shown up for their neighbors. But, there is still work to do and there will be for years to come.
‚Ä¢
When the Tubbs fire took entire neighborhoods in my hometown of Santa Rosa, CA - the shock and pain was immense. The effects are still very much felt and seen in those neighborhoods 7 years later. Witnessing that fire through the eyes of my Dad, a fire captain, was so scary. Witnessing it through the eyes of many friends who lost everything, was heartbreaking.

We do not yet know the cause of these fires. Investigations are ongoing. 

The City of Los Angeles is one of 88 cities in Los Angeles County. These cities each have their own mayor. Karen Bass is the mayor only for Los Angeles and is not responsible for what is happening in the other 87 cities. 

Firefighters have knocked down at least 10 other smaller fires since beginning the battle against the two biggest fires (Palisades and Eaton). 

The fires have burned over 45 square miles, which is double the size of my college town, Ruston, LA. 

Firefighters did not run out of water. The fire hydrants (and their tanks) are made to fight fires from a few houses, not hundreds. The tanks could not be refilled quickly enough. 

The reservoirs in L.A. County are full (except one which had been drained for repairs since this is typically a wetter time of year).

These fires could not be fought from the air for days because of the constant high winds. We are still experiencing winds a week later. 

Please guard yourself against misinformation. And don‚Äôt judge things you know nothing about. We can‚Äôt all be experts in everything.

-been a rollercoaster week round these parts. from what was a a joyous trip to Tahoe with some buds ending in our eyes glued to the television as the Palisades fire began with our families back home, then seeing and hearing of friends lives go up in flames, to a precautionary evacuation ourselves from the Kenneth fire, followed by a round trip to San Jose in rememberance of the life of my wife‚Äôs 101 year old grandmother. We‚Äôve not had time to think about anything much but rather, simply react. 

-we are back now, boots on the ground here in LA and still trying to process everything and figure out a way we can help. 

-first, will be transitioning our one for one everyone campaign funds from 2025 to benefit those personally affected. So know 5% of every purchase will be used to this effort. I‚Äôll personally match the 5% as well. 

-second, we‚Äôd love to be some boots on the ground in our local West Valley/Topanga area to help anyone who may need some support. 

-third, I‚Äôm still thinking. 

Sending love and our condolences to everyone out here in the Los Angeles area who has suffered from these horrendous fires. Please let us know how we can help. 

And an incredible thank you to all those firefighters, first responders, air attack pilots and every soul who has showed up to help fight these flames. Yall are heroes! 

Yours truly.

I love this city so much. I‚Äôve spent most of my adult life and most of my career here photographing its beauty. It is gut-wrenching to watch it burn. 

What has been deeply encouraging to me is watching our community rally together to care for each other. My prayer is that we don‚Äôt lose steam and that we keep our arms reached out to the ones who need us right now and for the long road ahead. 

Here are just a few ways you can reach your arms out: 

Master list of wedding industry creatives who were directly impacted (direct GFMs) - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1QU_3-uokeRNksHxD5c1wCbuntUZXoyFv7QlksyyT0/htmlview

@xokateevents and @rosieecheeeks are gathering $ on Venmo (KateWright-726 and rosie-spindel) and buying up supplies and gift cards and delivering them to local fire teams in different parts of the city.

Donate to @wckitchen and @redcrossla 

Vendors, if you can, send work and inquiries to the vendors who have lost their homes. They want to keep working and be part of their rebuilding efforts, too.

The recent Palisades fires in Los Angeles have claimed not only community landmarks but also pieces of the city‚Äôs rich architectural history. Iconic homes, each with a unique legacy, have shaped modern design and continue to inspire architects today.

Zane Grey Estate (1902): A Spanish-Mediterranean revival icon that influenced California‚Äôs love for terracotta roofs, stucco walls, and courtyards.

Andrew McNally House (1887): A Victorian masterpiece known for its craftsmanship, shaping Bay Area Victorian styles.
Keeler House (1990): A modern ‚Äú‚Äùtreehouse‚Äù‚Äù blending architecture with nature, showcasing innovation in harmony with the environment.

Janes Village (1924): European-style cottages fostering charm and community, emphasizing architecture‚Äôs role in lifestyle.

Gregory Ain‚Äôs Park Planned Homes (1948): Mid-century modern designs pioneering cost-efficient, functional prefabricated housing.

Bridges House: A cantilevered marvel blending bold engineering with the natural landscape.

These losses highlight the resilience of design, urging architects to integrate historical influences into modern homes, ensuring LA‚Äôs architectural legacy thrives.

My street and my house was still fine.  I got a call from a friend who wanted to go check on his two family houses in Altadena, so he picked me up and we started driving up Lincoln. It was like a scene out of a movie or something you see on social media. Flames on both sides of the street, homes, apartments, and businesses were all on fire. As we turned onto Loma Alta Dr it was 10 times worse. Everything was on fire or was next to a fire. We had to swerve out the way of power lines and trees that‚Äôve fallen down. We drove about 5 mph because u couldn‚Äôt see anything in front of you because of all the black smoke. We went to both of his family houses and they were both lost to the fire, smh. We drove around a lil longer and just couldn‚Äôt believe everything that was on fire. We even stopped at a friends house to give him a hand. I eventually told him to take me back home so I can wet my house and try to stop anything from happening to my home. I arrived to my street around 6am, surprised only one house was on fire. I began to water everything down, I mean everything! I started with the roof, then I sprayed the front of my home, then the yard & plants, and the driveway & cars. I did the same thing to the backyard as well and the sides of my home. I kept doin this until the water ran out around  7/8 o‚Äôclock. At this point I knew my chances of saving my home were very low. So I backed my lil foxbody mustang into the driveway and began to take stuff out of my home. As I was looking for stuff to grab I heard my neighbors yelling and honking for me so I ran outside. As soon as I got outside I saw my neighbors bushes on fire, it started to engulf my cars in the driveway. I only had enough time to jump in my mustang while I felt all the heat from the flames and move it down the street. As I walked back in disbelief, the whole right side of my home was in flames. I felt hopeless and it was all gone in a matter of mins‚Ä¶ If u would like to help me, my gofundme is in my bio. My last slide has other options for helping me.

If you have lost your home, contact me via email or DM for a free full length session. This offer does not expire. I recognize that you may not be able or ready to receive a treatment and so when and if you are, I am here for you.

For those of you who live in LA and would like a place to move out some emotions and stress and balance your nervous system, I have reserved Thursdays in January for you. With a pay what feels good pricing on 30 minute sessions so that I can support as many of you as possible. You can schedule these sessions directly through my website. 

Sending you love üíï 
We are strong, we are caring, and we are not alone! 
I have felt the presence of angels so palpable over the past week. The next time you feel overwhelmed, invite them to hold you in a healing cocoon.

These homes are just a mere block north of us right on the Altadena border. Had the winds and fires raged on just 15 minutes longer in this direction‚Ä¶our own home would‚Äôve been engulfed as well. It‚Äôs an unsettling truth and reality that I, along with my remaining neighbors, are wrestling with right now. 

I don‚Äôt have much to say right now other than that I am heartbroken and devastated for all my dear friends and neighbors who have had their lives completely upended. There is no consolation for the memories lost and their sanctuaries destroyed. 

In the meantime, I want to help the best I can. I am running a print drive to build an artist and fire relief fund. 100% of all proceeds will go toward the fund. Anyone who is of need and are impacted can apply - there are no barriers to entry. If you are in the position to donate, the link is in bio. Thank you for being here and holding space for us. We are so grateful.

In case anyone has missed it, we've been non-stop sharing resources on Mutual Aid. It's a lot. And it can be overwhelming--I know...

We are trying to organize resources by categories in our highlights and our Link tree will have a handful of links to extensive lists that provide everything from shelter and free meals to daycare and animal boarding... There are also lists of individuals impacted and their respective GoFundMe's.

We will continue to update our lists as well as share resources through our newsletter.

With that said... It's been a crazy few weeks, but we will now be resuming pop-ups starting with @allisonsgoods on Saturday, January 18 from 12 pm - 3 pm.

815 N Harbor Blvd Fullerton, CA 92832

10% of all January and February sales will go towards the LA Fire Mutual Aid.

And since we are a mobile pop-up and typically have very tight stock, we still want to offer free meals for those impacted by the Fires...

We'll be fulfilling individual requests for Bentos and will make sure they make it to you. We know it's a lot and many who are still grieving do not have the capacity or means to travel around town for free food.

Pre-orders for Saturday open NOW and will close 1/17. As stated in our monthly schedule post, we are reducing hours and cooking equipment for an indoor pop-up like this, and trying to focus a bit more on building our frozen dumpling business, so a limited amount of frozen packs will be offered for pre-orders.

And with all the recent chaos, I am a bit disoriented too and split between commitments... So if I make a mistake or take longer to make orders, please bear with me... It's just me here at team INOMONI so far..

Grief is one of the most complex human emotions, and our hearts mirror the scarred landscape of what was just so recently the image of stability and beauty.

District Attorneys Hochman and Spitzer are calling on California Governor Gavin Newsom to amend his prior proclamation to convene special session of the state Legislature in order to enact urgency legislation that would increase the punishment for looting, send defendants convicted of looting to state prison, require suspected looters to go before a judge instead of being allowed to be cited and released, and make looting ineligible for diversion, which under current law allows defendants to have their crimes erased from their record as if the arrest never occurred.

They lived about 7 minutes apart from each other. The neighborhoods created during this time were  hard working families who cared about love and the American dream. Neighbors became lifelong members of your own family and over the years these homes would be passed down to their children. Generations of families who never left these homes.

My mom and dad grew up in both Pasadena and Altadena. My father attended Pasadena High School and my mother attended John Muir High School. Even though my parents moved away from the town, they worked in Pasadena. When I was a child, they would drop me off at my grandma house or a host of my aunts houses five days a week. My mom worked at Huntington Hospital and my father coached the Varsity football team at John Muir for years and then Pasadena High. I grew up being able to see all my family on the same day whenever I was in town.

My grandmother‚Äôs house (the family house) is gone where all of the White family memories (photo albums, bibles, past down heirlooms ect) were kept. My Aunt Tommie‚Äôs home and my cousins‚Äô homes are also gone. shFaith and I were just recently at my grandmother‚Äôs house a month ago. She took a picture on the steps where I played. Never thinking that was the last time we would see it. 
 
The memories of my family lived in the walls and dirt of the earth of these homes. The air, the streets and the trees are reminders of their legacy, hopes and dreams for us. But last week we could have lost our entire family all in one night. That is not lost on me. My family is alive.
 
Lord Jesus please cover Los Angeles County and Southern California with your holy protection. Every person & every responder.

As many of you know, Los Angeles, my home, has experienced an unimaginable disaster. Countless people I know have lost everything. The sense of disbelief, displacement, shock, sadness, and even anger is palpable‚Äîand anger, I‚Äôm sure, will surface for many as they process this tragedy.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Yet, amidst the devastation, there is a glimmer of hope in the resilience and kindness of the human spirit. Angelenos have come together in remarkable ways, organizing support on the ground and offering help from every direction.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
On a personal note, during the week I was under a mandatory evacuation order, I felt anxious, scared, sad, and paralyzed. I can‚Äôt begin to fathom the depth of loss for those who‚Äôve not only been displaced but have also lost their homes, their communities, and the physical history of their lives. It is devastation in its truest sense‚Äîbeyond what words can capture.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
So many of you have reached out to ask how you can help, and I am deeply grateful. I will share resources as they become available. In the meantime, know that your prayers, thoughts, and simply checking in on people make a difference. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Thank you for your kindness and support.‚†Ä

Both fires spread at a critical rate, with the high winds pushing embers into homes and raining down into neighborhoods miles ahead. Since starting, the fires have collectively charred nearly 38,000 acres, and an estimated 16,500 structures have been destroyed.

Story and images for @19thnews ‚ú®üôèüèΩ *Each four women have their GoFundMe page linked in their sections. 

During the civil rights movement, Altadena was one of the few areas offering home loans to Black families, boosting the Black population from 4% in 1968 to 27% by 1970. Before the fires, Black homeownership in the area was 81.5%, nearly double the national average.¬†

Today, Altadena remains a working-class, multicultural community, with 58% of residents being people of color.¬†Rebuilding homes, many of which were fully paid off and passed down through generations, will be much more difficult for Altadena residents than those in surrounding affluent neighborhoods.

Anniah Baynes.¬†
The fire destroyed the home Anniah Baynes, an 18-year-old high school senior, shared with her grandmother, aunt and three younger siblings.

Now staying with her mother just blocks from where she lived, Baynes has struggled in the aftermath of the fire. ‚ÄúI feel traumatized,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want to be somewhere far away from the smell of the smoke, where I can‚Äôt see the mountains on fire.‚Äù

A week before the fire, Baynes proudly showed her classmates her hair, which she had done herself over the holiday break.Now, returning to school feels impossible. As the eldest of seven, she has taken on the responsibility of staying strong for her siblings. ‚ÄúI try not to cry in front of my younger siblings. I want to show them I‚Äôm strong and that we‚Äôre going to be OK,‚Äù she said.

Despite the challenges, Baynes finds comfort in the support she‚Äôs received from friends and family. Her friends created a GoFundMe page to help the family recover, and relatives in the area have stepped in to offer assistance. And yet, she yearns what she lost. ‚ÄúAll the support that I am getting is great,‚Äù Baynes said. ‚ÄúI love it and appreciate it, but I just really want my home back.‚Äù¬†

I was out documenting the aftermath when I came across this scene right here and it really affected me.  Seeing the washer and dryer made me think of  the family that lived here.  Possibly with young children.  I imagined the mother doing laundry and the kids sitting at the table keeping mom company.  Not sure why that thought crossed my mind but it hit me hard.

Thank you for all the concern‚Ä¶. üíô
@therealjeremymiller and I are safe at this time. 
We are staying at a home close to one of the volunteer evacuation areas. 

Today, it's been a week of fires everywhere! üò¢üò≠ So much lose I can't even put into words. üò≠üò≠
The winds have been kicking up even more again yesterday and today. 
More fires popping up all over but our AMAZING firefighters and first responders have been Killin it!!! 
GOD BLESS ALL YOU WHO ARE FIGHTING THESE FIRES! üôèüôèüôè
(and  those that are fighting evil people taking advantage of this situation! #looters ü§¨ #pricegouging üò° #arsen etc... )
Also many thanks and blessings to those coming from various states AND countries!! üíôü•∞üíãüòçüôèüíôüôè THANK YOU ALL FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è
( Even 4 from my brother's unit, from out of state, are here helping.) 

So far, that we know of, 2 of my babies ( newborn specialist jobs) have completely lost their homes.... some of our good friends have lost everything and many others we know of. 

These fires, this yr, have horribly impacted so many people All OVER in the Los Angeles area. 
Our hearts break for those, that have been in the heart of these fires for days now üò¢üò≠üò¢
It is so horrifying to even have to drive past these fires, let alone run through them! üò≠ ( and these #FireTornado OMGOODNESS!!! I had to ask my brother and get more details on these cause that is even more panicking to me. See video from ABC attached in my pics on  this post)

A few yrs ago Jeremy and I had to drive through fires that were on BOTH SIDES of the freeways!!! It was like driving on  a road threw a volcano. Lava looking fire on both sides... almost what I imagine HELL might look like. 
 It was the one of the scariest anxiety filled emotional times of my ( and unfortunately I have been through alot of death defying circumstances üò¢). 

Praying and praying for all our friends ( and everyone)  who have had to evacuate from many areas already,  and even lost their homes . 
Praying for all! üôèüôèüôè

Much gratitude and thanks to everyone who has reached out this past week. Many of you know my residence is near the Eaton Canyon trail head. My home is still intact, but uninhabitable without gas, electricity, or clean water at the moment. I‚Äôm deeply saddened by the amount of loss that has occurred in my neighborhood. Words can‚Äôt express the heart break, but simultaneously, I‚Äôve been moved by the power of community and resilience that has unfolded despite the tragedies.

Starting today, I‚Äôll be conducting a fundraiser where 100% of ceramics sales will go out to the families who have lost homes in the Eaton fire and across Los Angeles. There are countless friends and loved ones who still need funds to get back on their feet. 

The conditions for the fundraiser are, just select the pieces you are interested in by scrolling through my post and I‚Äôll message you with pricing & dimensions. I have a select number of sculptures and pottery. I‚Äôll be posting more throughout the week.

Comment below or message me the letter of the piece.

A second option is - If you have a specific family or fire relief organization you‚Äôd like to support, just donate the price of the piece to the family or organization and send me a screenshot of the confirmation.

Local pick-up & shipping options are available for those who aren‚Äôt nearby the Pasadena area.

Thank you for supporting our communities that have been affected by these fires.

As we see the destruction and heartbreak in Los Angeles, we‚Äôre reminded of our own experience with the CZU fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains in 2020. That fire destroyed many homes and lives, including those of our friends and neighbors. The memories of that time have deeply shaped how we approach fire safety in design.

During the CZU fire, a 1,000-acre property we worked on was devastated, yet the only structure left standing was the one we built with fireproof materials like Corten steel and CMU blocks. This experience profoundly impacted us, and it continues to guide our efforts to design with resilience and fire safety at the forefront.

In Los Angeles and other fire-prone areas, the opportunity to rebuild is also a chance to prioritize fire safety. Simple yet powerful strategies like defensible space, ember-resistant vents, and fire-rated materials can make a life-saving difference. These measures, while sometimes overlooked, are essential to creating homes that are not just beautiful but built to endure.

To everyone affected by these fires, we stand with you. We understand the loss and uncertainty that follows such devastation, and we believe in a future where smarter, safer building practices can help protect lives, homes, and memories from the threat of wildfires.

Fireproof design can be beautiful, and we have had the incredible opportunity of designing thoughtful homes for our clients that provide invaluable peace of mind for their families and safeguard their irreplaceable memories.

The Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, and Hurst Fire in Los Angeles have burned through a combined 38,629 acres as of January 14th. This is an area equivalent to roughly 93% of the total land area of the Bronx and Manhattan, which together cover 41,510 acres.

This map is intended to help those unfamiliar with Los Angeles better understand the scale of this active wildfire. By comparing the fire perimeter to a city like New York, we can get a clearer sense of its size. If you‚Äôre curious about seeing LA fire perimeters over your city to grasp the magnitude of these wildfires, feel free to DM me.

The fire perimeter is as of January 14th, 2025 at 1:00pm.

Yesterday, fire officials guided me through a survey of the damage. Even after seeing photos and videos, I wasn‚Äôt prepared for the sheer magnitude of what‚Äôs been lost.

I spoke with our first responders about what worked and what didn‚Äôt in the days running up to the fire and ensuing fight. The information I received dispels any notion of simple solutions‚Äîbut it‚Äôs clear that with certain reforms and investments, we can be better prepared in the future. 

There‚Äôs a long road ahead, but we will rebuild together. As the dust settles, I hope to share more concrete updates on how the government is responding to this disaster and preparing for future fires. Stay tuned. #palisadesfire #eatonfire",2025-01-15 02:26:21+00:00

everything going on in people‚Äôs lives that were affected by the fires. It was a pleasure sharing laughs and some emotional conversations with these amazing people. I had the opportunity to build connections and friendships. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing to see everyone come together when sometimes all we feel is loneliness and like maybe there is no more hope left in humanity. The world needs more of this. We all need to stick together to make change. If it is one thing I did in the last two days, it‚Äôs that I hope I was able to make someone feel loved and cared for. To make a difference in these crazy times. I know I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything but seeing everyone‚Äôs face light up in the mirror‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a feeling that I will never forget. When I close my eyes at night they will forever be in my heart. Heads high LA. We‚Äôll come back stronger. Much love to The City Of Angelsüíô

Jeffrey is a Los Angeles native who has studied tea ceremony since age 9, a discipline which contributes to all other parts of his life and work. When he‚Äôs not at work, he‚Äôs often camping in the wilderness around Los Angeles, exploring his physical capabilities climbing trees and rocks so that he can observe a new vista. Jeffrey converts these experiences into his art practice, for which he recently graduated with honors from the Art Center, Pasadena.

Jeffrey has applied his skills and fortitude to his work with the gallery as our main installation technician for each of our exhibitions over the past five years. If you‚Äôve enjoyed exhibitions at Nonaka-Hill, it‚Äôs been Jeffrey, behind the scenes, reliably keeping pace and high standards. We are grateful.

The gallery team supports Jeffrey as he responds to this challenge. Having lost almost everything, a public GoFundMe campaign is set up for Jeffrey Sugishita to receive community goodwill. Contributions of any amount will help Jeffrey rebound and get back on track with his emerging art practice.

I‚Äôve waited a while to actually write something because I have been so consumed and deeply saddened by all the destruction the Palisades & Eaton Fires have caused. I have been trying to even figure out what to say as I know words do not give comfort at times like this. 

I have also been processing my own PTSD as fires have and will always greatly affect me. As a kid I went through a great deal of trauma due to the Santa Barbara Painted Cave fire 1990 and again with the Thomas Fire and Mudslide in 2017/2018. So many of my memories have been placed along side fire events. The rest of the US and World thinks this is all normal for us. It may happen a lot and more and more often now but it is not and will never be normal. Fires don‚Äôt discriminate, they don‚Äôt care if you are rich or poor, black or white, gay or straight. They crush the things you hold dear. These fires have killed 25 people. 25 loved ones! 

I think about how deeply affected I have been and I haven‚Äôt even lost a home or loved one. I think about how sad and heavy hearted all those are who have and how the loss of a home is so massive, the loss of a loved one even greater but the trauma of it all is longer lasting. This will last for years! 

As a designer we help people create these well loved and cherished sacred spaces and to have something so quickly destroy it all is beyond devastating. If we can bring some happiness, relief or even help make some people laugh through this we will.

With that Designology will be giving a free 1-hour design consultation to those who have lost a home or business. If you have or know someone who has been affected and they need help trying to rebuild we are here. Please email us at info@designologystudio.com. You are not in this alone! 

All our love!

Hiding the destruction that would soon ravage homes and land. Small embers, carried by the gusts, sparked spot fires, setting off a chain reaction that ultimately destroyed at least 7,000 structures and killed 16, with that number expected to rise.

It was a windy Sunday, with forecasts predicting hurricane-force winds up to 100 mph. The KeyNews team was on standby, one photographer already reporting from the Palisades on the widespread damage. Winds in the San Fernando Valley hadn‚Äôt been severe yet, so I headed to Altadena to cover a tree that had fallen on a house. I arrived just after 6 p.m., when a fire engine and sheriff‚Äôs unit pulled in. As the alert tones sounded, the first responders turned and raced toward the growing fire which would soon be named the Eaton Fire. I followed close behind, and as I rounded the corner, the sky glowed bright orange.

Being one of the first on the scene, I knew the situation was dire. The wind howled as I quickly set up, battling gusts while trying to put on my fire protective gear and film the advancing flames. It was a race against time.

Reports came in of people trapped, homes burning, and roads clogged with evacuations. I made my way to North Altadena and New York Drive. As I arrived, I was choked by hot, smoky air, attempting to find my respirator. Embers flew and power lines arched overhead. Then I heard a man screaming, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the fire department? Help, my house is burning.‚Äù

I tried to locate him, but I never could. That cry for help became all too common as the fire spread. There weren‚Äôt enough resources, not enough water, and visibility was near zero. Spot fires ignited everywhere, one feeding another in a deadly chain reaction. Firefighters were exhausted, and their resources were draining while the wind blew water away as they fought to save what they could‚Ä¶photos by @bennydavisphoto #EatonFire #altadenafire #firefighterheros #staysafe #verdugomountains #wildfire #wildfireseason",2025-01-15 03:40:47+00:00

It is hard to know where to start and what we can do to best support each other. 

I have been thinking almost non-stop about how Trilogy Design LA and my family can support each other and, most importantly, those affected by the fires. Home is a special place to me and is the mission behind my business. It is a place of comfort, retreat, healing, and safety, and so many of my friends have lost that. 

As people begin to find places to relocate, we are asking for donations of furniture and home goods.  If you know of anyone who needs furnishings or home goods as they relocate, or if you have something you would like to donate, please let me know. We are working on compiling a donation list as well as a ‚ÄúNeeds‚Äù Google sheet. 

We also need storage space for the items donated. If you know anyone who would be willing to donate a storage unit or space for the next few months in the Pasadena area, please let me know. We would even take an unleashed storefront to use for a month. We are also looking for temporary use of a delivery van or truck. Other ways you could help are by organizing donations and retrieving/delivering donations.

If you would like to donate money to support these efforts, you can Venmo me @Amy-Guthrie-2. We will use the money donated to directly support pick-up and delivery. Any leftover funds will be used for purchasing sheets, towels, and other home goods. 

A friend of mine who lost her home shared this quote this morning in an email. It is so beautifully written by Octavia Butler who lived and is interred in Altadena. 

‚ÄúParadise is home. Home as it was or home as it should have been. Paradise is one‚Äôs own place, one‚Äôs own people, one‚Äôs own world, knowing and known, perhaps even loving and loved. Yet every child is cast from paradise - into growth and destruction, into solitude and new community, into vast, ongoing change.‚Äù
~Octavia E. Butler, Parable of the Talents

I look forward to seeing how we can join together as a beautiful community to support one another.

I went to the volunteer area and got supplies to make signs.
Most needed were the signs leading people to donation drop off and pick up, but I was informed by a ConEd employee doing security that people were getting lost trying to exit the vast parking lot, some ending up in the staging area for some emergency vehicles (gas/electric) - it got worse after sundown. üò©
So I ended up spending a ridiculous amount of time making posters and fighting with cheap packing tape to get the signs up, but was able to help people get where they needed to go.
I noticed the ConEd people were not being fed so I went back to grab them food.
It was then I realized there were so many LESS people at the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù.
APPARENTLY, the organizers have wised up to the fact that a vast amount of people coming I. For donations yesterday weren‚Äôt actually victims of the fire. Yep, a ton of people yesterday were just there to basically steal from people that lost their homes.
So now people will have to bring ID.

Not gonna lie, it seemed obvious yesterday not everyone had just lost a home, but I think no one wanted to admit people would just straight up take advantage of the circumstances. Some people are obvious, they act like they‚Äôre on a shopping trip and are HAPPY. Some people are nervous when you look at them. Some people act guilty, but was I going to challenge people? Not my job.

But tons of people were taking video and pictures, I wonder if some people will be found out. It‚Äôs disappointing.",2025-01-15 04:21:44+00:00

The beach has always been my happy place and over the years, I‚Äôve found solace in being so close to it. Though we no longer live in Malibu, I‚Äôd always find a reason to go back there at least once a month‚Ä¶driving PCH vs taking the 101 to/from LA was always such a treat! Anytime I had friends in town, I‚Äôd make reservations at my favorite places to ensure they got to experience my little slice of heaven.

It's hard to smile at times like this but it's nice to know that there are heroes in the world that come together during a disaster.

They are expecting extreme Santa Ana winds tonight through Wednesday night.  If the fire activity picks up, it could take the fire towards NASA JPL facilities.  Today, JPL firefighters walked E43 crews along with other task force members to recognize hazards associated with these JPL facilities.  It's crucial that the crews understand that the fire could end up once the fire activity picks up.  They also surveyed homes around JPL as well.  The brush in socal is as dry as it would be during the height of the fire season.  We are still in active fire season.

A lot of people have asked what firefighters need.  We will tell you that we are taken care of well on these fires. The fire camp for the Eaton Fire is at rhe Rose Bowl.  In camp we have everything to meet our needs.  If anybody needs anything, it's the people who have lost everything. Please consider donations to people who lost their jobs in the Eaton Fire.

Some of you may already know, but for those that don‚Äôt, our dear friend, Alain lost his home and all of the contents in the recent and ongoing Eaton Fire here in California. Most importantly, he and his children are safe and unharmed.

The fire destroyed the home he lived in and he has lost everything except a few instruments, his music library and the clothes he was wearing at the time of the evacuation. He is basically starting over... completely.

We have received several messages asking about his well-being and he is eternally grateful. Apologies for being unable to reply to each message directly.

As a means of helping him and his family get back to some sort of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life, there is now a GoFundMe account set up for donations. If you can help at all, with any amount, it would be appreciated more than you know. It‚Äôs a big request, as there are so many other people already affected by the fires and there will likely be many more, but even a small donation in order to help him and the kids get a start would be wonderful üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

Please read more at the attached link and donate there if you can. Any excess donations will be reapportioned to others in the community that need additional help.

Thank you all in advance and even if you can‚Äôt donate, please share this as much as you possibly can and leave a few words of encouragement below.

This is post about the Eaton Fire. In it, I captured a hawk perched on a light post‚Äîa fleeting moment that has stayed with me ever since.

I took the photo through a 40-year-old window, part of the structure I sheltered in as the storm raged. The wind howled with such force that the glass seemed to crackle under the strain, and I feared it might shatter. That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I watched the fire grow, my heart weighed down with fear‚Äînot just for myself, but for my neighbors near the flames.

The second photo, taken a day earlier, shows a sky smothered in dark, ashen smoke. It loomed over Altadena and Pasadena, and I knew then that parts of the town had been consumed by fire. Yet, knowing didn‚Äôt prepare me for the scale of the devastation that followed.

Now, as I reflect on these photos, I think about that hawk. Perhaps it was fleeing the fire, seeking refuge from the polluted air and the chaos below. Even amid the destruction, it found its way to a light post‚Äîa small, unwavering beacon in the storm. Hawks are often seen as symbols of change, wisdom, and protection, and I can‚Äôt help but see a reflection of our community in that bird‚Äîsteadfast, adaptable, and enduring.

The hawk‚Äôs flight reminds me of the strength and resilience I‚Äôve witnessed in those around me. In the face of fear and loss, we have come together‚Äîlifting one another up, healing, and rebuilding what was taken. This is the spirit of our community: a testament to hope, courage, and unyielding resilience.

While we‚Äôre still actively covering everything that‚Äôs been impacted by it, just taking a moment to reflect back on those hazy/chaotic first 24 hours.

We knew the wind was going to be bad that day, and producer @jimseida and I had our fire gear ready to go in case anything came up, but we obviously never could have anticipated this. 

I‚Äôll never forget getting stuck in gridlock traffic that day on Sunset Blvd, brush fires on either side of the road. Firefighters putting them out, assuring us we were okay. Then getting out and seeing so many abandoned cars from people who gave up and walked, followed by a massive bulldozer that came through to push them out of the way to clear a path.

When we finally made it to the Pacific Coast Highway, I‚Äôll never forget the moment @jimseida saw an ember fly onto a palm tree on the beach. Within five minutes - as we reported live on @topstorynbc - the cluster of trees was up in flames. Looking back now, that was the moment things really took a turn. Police told us to leave that beach and drive south. The winds were like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced growing up in Southern California. 

Just hours later, when we came back in the middle of the night for our @todayshow hit, it looked like basically all of PCH was on fire. In Malibu, home after home of beachfront properties up in flames. 

In the week since, we‚Äôve spoken to a countless number of people whose lives have been upended. So, so many who have lost their homes or businesses. We spoke to a woman whose grandmother died in her beloved Altadena house because she didn‚Äôt think she really needed to evacuate. We spoke to a teacher who lost his home but instead of worrying about himself has been nonstop texting/checking on his students. We talked to high school girls who have already had so many years of school disrupted by covid, only to be preparing for remote classes yet again after their campus in the fire zone was largely destroyed. And of course, we met Casey and sweet Tika Tika Tika & Oreo, who gave me - and I‚Äôve gathered many others - a little bright spot in all this sorrow. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî #palisadesfire #eatonfire #losangeles",2025-01-15 06:09:52+00:00

Accompanied by our Fire Chief, we visited ground zero in the affected areas of Altadena.

The devastation is overwhelming‚Äîso many homes destroyed, and countless families now facing unimaginable loss. It‚Äôs hard to put into words the pain and uncertainty these families must be feeling in this moment.

But amidst this tragedy, I am deeply moved by the extraordinary efforts of those working tirelessly to protect lives and contain the fire. Our firefighters‚Äîmany of whom have traveled from across the country‚Äîfirst responders, the National Guard, public works teams, and countless others are showing us what true dedication and resilience look like.

To those impacted by this fire, know that you are not alone. Our community stands with you, and we will do everything in our power to support your recovery. My deepest gratitude goes out to everyone working around the clock to keep us safe. Your bravery and commitment remind us of the strength we have as a community when we come together.

Stay safe, and let us keep those affected in our thoughts and prayers.

Steve did the best he could to defend the building but it was destroyed. No one knows what happened to the basement. We reached out to multiple government agencies for help. Our local LA County fire inspector Brad Sizemore was able to help and shared these photos with us today. While we expected the worst, it still hurt a lot to see üò≠. Everything inside was burnt to dust. A few hundred thousands worth of equipment and inventory is a lot for our small business. In the mean time, we are doing our best to get our crew working safely elsewhere to minimize the impact to their livelihood during this challenging time.

Thank you for your patience as I‚Äôve been pushing to get an update out amidst power and internet outages.

Tonight marks one week since the Eaton fire and the evacuation from our precious home in the now decimated shire of Altadena.

With the overwhelming outpouring of love, support and mind blowing generosity, it has allowed us to move mountains in just one week.

With every task, a new set of tasks. Hours on the road pulling all of the pieces together. Lists and lists. Small patches of sleep. Lakes of coffee. Oreos and crying.

Like so many others in LA struggling to restart and rebuild their lives as a result of the devastating wildfires, we have been navigating layers of resources and tools, staying close with our community, and supporting where we can. Everyone has been breathtakingly supportive and awesome. So so so many incredible people in our lives.

Some days start with a good cry, other days kick off with a hyperactive burst of energy to conquer the world to offset the darkness of loss.

The path ahead is long, but fantastically hopeful.

Our families, friends, colleagues, neighbors and the vibrant, incredible community around us have swooped in to support us.

We are so grateful, so honored, so humbled.

We are safe and still currently based comfortably well outside LA and Altadena in Perris (CA).

We are navigating back and forth from our base camp in Perris into LA to look for housing, acquire donated clothing and basic supplies and connect with friends who are sharing the same experiences and who have also lost everything. The winds are still very strong out in the desert, so we are getting as much done as we can in between outages.

We are making gradual progress and are slowly putting the pieces of our lives back together and planning‚Ä¶ all the while, trying to remain grounded, positive, kind and thankful amidst some notable adversity. Some days are harder than others.

We are fortunate to have each other.

We are fortunate to have YOU.

More updates forthcoming.

Wishing all of you safety and health.

Respectfully,
Chris, Monica and Kes

The City of Sierra Madre never lost system pressure and did not suffer any damage to its critical water infrastructure during the Eaton Fire. The city has conducted an initial assessment of the water system with routine bacteriological samples taken throughout the system. All samples were analyzed by a third-party certified lab and found no coliform bacteria. 

This measure is out of an abundance of caution to prioritize resident's health and safety. 

Follow @cityofsierramadre for more updates.

One of my favourite places in Altadena also seems particularly prescient right now. 

At the top of Echo Mountain, via the Sam Merrill trail, sit the ruins of the hotel and mountain railroad, part of a Victorian resort named White City, built by Thaddeus Lowe in 1893 above Altadena.

From its grand opening through to its eventual abandonment in 1936, fire and wind ravaged the resort several times, but they continued to rebuild. 

Today, standing up there among the ruins feels simultaneously inspiring and cautionary. It would be understatement to say I can't wait to get back up there again soon.

If I only had a few minutes to grab things, what would I grab first? What would I have to leave behind and potentially have to say good-bye to?

Naturally, when I start to feel anxious, I‚Äôll lean on a checklist. 

So I put together a checklist that lists the things you‚Äôll want to try and grab in case of an emergency evacuation. I tried to group the items so you could have things stored together to grab easily in a hurry. 

I hope that you never have to use this checklist, but if you do, I hope it gives you peace of mind.

‚Å£
I was reading my insurance documents last night, and the fire danger score at my current house was zero. Maybe that‚Äôs why I find myself so woefully unprepared physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, to handle something like losing my entire neighborhood. ‚Å£

That said, I‚Äôd like to send a massive thank you to the firefighters and first responders who I don‚Äôt feel are getting enough credit for risking their lives to save ours. ‚Å£

El tercer evento de Vientos de Santa Ana est√° pautado para el pr√≥ximo Lunes 20 de Enero, 2025, en el Sur de California. 

Esta proyecci√≥n preliminar apunta a que ser√° un evento entre moderado a fuerte con r√°fagas de viento entre 30-40 MPH, posiblemente +50 MPH con ese componente de vientos del noreste. 

Ese porcentaje de probabilidad de 40% podr√≠a cambiar en los pr√≥ximos d√≠as. Recuerden que un pron√≥stico m√°s certero se emite 3 d√≠as antes del evento.

ACTUALMENTE: Los vientos de Santa Ana permanecen activos particularmente en el condado Ventura, raz√≥n por la cual el Aviso de Bandera Roja fue extendido hasta el Jueves 16 de Enero, 2025, para dicho sector hasta las 3PM.

EN CONCLUSI√ìN: Los recurrentes vientos de Santa Ana estar√°n elevando ese potencial de incendios hasta finales de Enero, tras la escasez de precipitaciones en noreste zona.

As a group of supporters prayed for the family, Delva Gibson, 82, held her husband tightly. The Gibsons lost their home of nearly 52 years in the fire. It was the only home she has known since immigrating from Brazil.

Married for over 50 years, she and her husband raised their two sons in the house. The couple is currently staying with their son in San Bernardino. The loss is profound, but Gibson is finding clarity amidst the tragedy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new beginning for us this year,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe material things are not important. What is important is that we, as a family, are OK.‚Äù

Rose Hayes‚ú®
Rose Hayes sits at the Habit Burger & Grill in Hastings Ranch, reflecting on the destruction of her Altadena home of 20 years.

The house belonged to her husband‚Äôs family for over five decades, passed down through generations. Its history is part of the broader story of Black homeownership in Altadena, which was seen as a haven during the Great Migration, when Black Americans moved from the South to find safety and jobs in other parts of the country. 

It‚Äôs a tight-knit Black community that‚Äôs been here for a long time, Hayes said. ‚ÄúEverybody knows everybody,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe look out for each other.‚Äù

Now the future is uncertain for the 66-year-old, who also lives with her granddaughter. Her family is staying at an Airbnb for nine days for free, and then they have a week paid for by their rental insurance at a hotel. After that, they are unsure of where they will go. Like many others in Altadena, Hayes‚Äôs family is leaning on community support to begin rebuilding their lives.

‚ÄúEveryone keeps telling me to have hope, but I don‚Äôt feel it. I can‚Äôt see it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI loved opening the door of my home and seeing the mountains. Now it‚Äôs like a bomb went off.‚Äù

üì≤Stay connected: Talk to friends, family, or neighbors. Sharing experiences and checking in on one another can provide comfort and strengthen bonds.

üì∫Limit media consumption: Staying informed is essential, but constant exposure to distressing news can heighten anxiety. Set boundaries to protect your mental health.

üß†Seek professional help: If feelings of grief or anxiety become too much, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to a counselor or therapist for support.

I‚Äôd like to ease the burden of trying to navigate the system.

No quick fixes for this kind of loss. The truth is, when someone is grieving‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs their home, their community, or the places that made them feel safe‚Äîwhat you say can either help them breathe or make it harder for them to hold on.

As parents, we‚Äôre tasked with the impossible: showing up for our children when we feel broken ourselves. Answering their questions when we have none of the answers. Trying to rebuild their sense of safety while we‚Äôre still grasping for our own. And in the midst of this, we‚Äôre surrounded by well-meaning words that sometimes help‚Äîand sometimes hurt.

This is why I created this guide. To share what‚Äôs been truly supportive during this unimaginable time, as a human being, and also as a behavioral scientist‚Äîand what hasn‚Äôt. My hope is that it helps you find the words to show up for someone who‚Äôs grieving, whether they‚Äôve lost everything or feel lost in what‚Äôs left.

Because in moments like these, it‚Äôs not about having the perfect thing to say‚Äîit‚Äôs about being there, with compassion, presence, and the courage to simply sit with their pain. Together, we‚Äôll take this one messy, overwhelming step at a time.üíî

Learn how these critical ecosystems are facing immense challenges in the wake of the flames. ‚û°Ô∏è

üåµ Chaparral
Chaparral dominates parks such as Topanga State Park and Will Rogers State Historic Park, providing shelter for coyotes, bobcats, quails, and more. While chaparral is fire-adapted, frequent, intense fires can prevent full recovery, leading to erosion and habitat loss for these species.

üåø Coastal Sage Scrub
Coastal sage scrub, found in parks like Topanga State Park, is one of the rarest and most endangered habitats in California. Fires can devastate this ecosystem, destroying native plants like California sagebrush and buckwheat, which take years to regenerate. Without these plants, the habitat loses its ability to support specialized species.

üê∏ Wetlands
Wetlands, like those at Malibu Lagoon State Beach, serve as vital habitats for amphibians, fish, and migratory birds. Fires can dry out these water-rich areas, destroy vegetation that provides cover and nesting grounds, and disrupt the delicate balance that keeps these ecosystems thriving.

üå≥ Oak Woodlands
Oak woodlands, like those at Malibu Creek State Park, are critical for biodiversity, offering food and shelter to countless species. Wildfires can weaken or kill mature oaks, making it difficult for new trees to grow. This long recovery process impacts the entire ecosystem, from pollinators to larger mammals that rely on these trees.

üçÉ Grasslands
Grasslands, like those at Chino Hills State Park, are highly flammable and burn quickly during wildfires. While these ecosystems can recover, repeated fires deplete native grasses and open the door for invasive species like mustard plants, which further increase fire risks.

For updates on parks impacted by the fires, please visit parks.ca.gov/Incidents

It was a community of dreamers, hikers, adventurers. It was a place you could visit to get outside, enjoy some amazing views, and still have the conveniences of being close to the city. It had the most accessible hikes, and it was amazing to have this gem.

It was a place @tayste5000 and I frequented because of its close proximity to Pasadena. It‚Äôs where we did some of our first LA hikes together after I finally moved to LA. It‚Äôs where I woke up extra early to go on a birthday hike on my 30th birthday. It‚Äôs where we would go if we woke up late but still wanted to do a quick hike. And now, these hikes, as well as the community and businesses around it, are gone, and it‚Äôs absolutely devestating. My heart goes out to those who lost everything in the fires.

To honor this amazing place, here‚Äôs some memories from hikes that we did in the past. Locations showcased: Echo Mountain, Mount Lowe, Eaton Canyon, Sunset Ridge, Inspiration Point, and Rubio Canyon (and its waterfall).

Stay Inside ‚Äì Stay alert on air quality conditions with the AirNow Fire and Smoke Map. If you are in an area with poor air quality, stay inside as much as possible. Close windows and doors. 

Wear a Mask ‚Äì If you must go outside, an N95 respirator will provide the best protection against wildfire smoke. Cloth masks will not help. 

Use an Air Cleaner ‚Äì Use a portable air cleaner or make your own using filters and box fans. Check out our website for instructions to make your own DIY air cleaner to reduce smoke indoors.

Take it Easy ‚Äì If you must be outside, in addition to wearing a mask, take frequent breaks indoors and avoid activities that cause heaving breathing, like exercising or mowing the lawn. This will reduce how much smoke you inhale. 

After the Smoke Clears ‚Äì When the air quality improves, even temporarily, open doors and windows to air out your home. If you are near a recent fire, our website has tips to safely clean up ash and debris if necessary.

Only when I moved away, my mother and I learned that we grew up next to the first home of Andrew McNally at Neff Park in La Mirada, California. He gifted that house as a wedding present and moved to Altadena. 

My understanding is Andrew McNally, co-founder and president of the Rand McNally publishing company. My family McNally were map makers and started in Ireland before coming over to the USA. 

There‚Äôs a McNally house in Chicago, Illinois where the Mapping company started and Neff park, Mr McNally‚Äôs second home in the US but the most impressive home was the Altadena house. 

I‚Äôm still going to try to learn as much as possible about my family. I do know that it has been many many many years since my family actually resided in any of these houses. 2 are historic houses meant for visiting only. And one was still livable with conditions. 

This is so terribly heart breaking. I was holding onto hope that maybe the fire just missed it ü•∫

I‚Äôm still watching the wildfire news. If anyone needs assistance, dm me and I‚Äôll see what I can do. Reach out if you need to talk. Reach out for anything my ghouls and baby bats. Stay safe out there

He found father and son attempting to fight back raging, horizontal flame with a garden hose. Dad sprung into action.

I heard his account of what happened later the same day, but it was mixed in with several other anecdotes. My cousin also called to say he had driven past my parents home to see that it was destroyed but didn't stop, both because the whole neighborhood was aflame and also because my dad was being interviewed by a news crew.

""Hmm,"" I thought, ""Dad didn't mention that part in his telling of it to me."" Then the news clips started being shared. You may have even seen one that was being shared here on IG.

But even more surreal was somebody sending a picture of the OC Register with my dad, embracing the neighbor's son, after having helped save his home from certain destruction. 

Here's a man who has given his entire life to lift up his family, right down to his grandkids, my kids and my niece. Then at the moment disaster struck, and knowing that his own family were all safely evacuated, applied that same love, care, helps, heroism, compassion - I don't even know what to call it!!! - to his community. My dad.

I believe Pic 1 is the last film photo I took of the front of my parents' home. It's from 2020, and my dad posed at my request. The color digital image is from 2019.

Many have reached out to ask how might they help my mom and dad. We had a family meeting, four households, last night to answer that question ourselves. My sisters and I have discussed several ideas, and if you would like to find out more please DM directly. Particularly if you know my parents personally and have visited the Sinaloa house, please reach out to me directly. 

FYI - some of you have asked, and we have no intention of starting a GFM campaign at this time, in part because Mom and Dad are getting bombarded by scammers who are attempting to do so in their name.

Thankfully, we were able to have them set up at @unbreakableperformance thanks to @u_getz & Jason! 

We had so many hands come out and donate their time along w/ clothes & other supplies that we were able to drop all off to multiple locations as well! 

From there we loaded up the cars and head to the National Guards to deliver them their pizza, and man were they EXCITED & GRATEFUL!!! There were TONS in the room right before my video recording, but most had just gotten called out & had to pack & load up in their trucks to leave. 

Got to hangout & chat with them, and I can‚Äôt tell you enough how great they all are. So kind, & good hearted..
Grateful to have been able to create new friendships with some of the Guards along with those that have all come together collectively this past week to volunteer & chip in one way or another. 

Reminder, if you ever see anyone on that is on Duty, regardless of whatever Department, Give them a smile and thank them for their service. You don‚Äôt know what that little bit can do for them and how appreciative they are‚Ä¶ It goes a long way. 

Stay tuned for Pt. 4 as the drop offs have continued..

But again, BIG THANK YOU to @celestedurve @u_getz @chefcrystalblanchette @akmirch for all coming together collectively to get this ship going & becoming such a great team. When you have the right people around you, You can accomplish great things..

We will continue to take any donations to sponsor meals as well as get supplies that are being requested to us directly from Sheriff/Fire Dept for the first responders. 
They are in dire need for different things such as 1 example hand warmers to keep them all warm at night & early morning as it gets VERY COLD outside. (Texts requesting have been posted & shown directly)

Honestly, i never thought my entire community would be burned down from these fires. This has been such a tragedy for me, my friends and family these past few days. I know SO many people who lost their homes,belongings and apartment complexes with little to nothing. Homes that were passed down generation to generation. All people of color. Our community in Pasadena / Altadena was OURS! This hurts so much but we have to rebuild and keep our homes as a community. This is VERY important. This is the city where all my child hood memories and friends are. This is the city that raised us. The city we all grew to LOVE and appreciate. Pasadena / Altadena has always been our home. Many of you know my father and some of you may not but those of you who do you know what kind of man he is. God fearing, family driven and willing to do just about anything to help anyone. Unfortunately everything he owned was burnt down in this fire literally EVERYTHING. Due to the severity of the evacuation he was not able to grab any of his items. If you know me u know how hard i work and my pops is a harder worker than me. We just ask that you donate what you can man. I never thought I‚Äôd be making a post like this but i thank God every day that he made it out alive. & if you can‚Äôt donate share the link please anything helps! Link in bio as well.

Their house wasn‚Äôt just a place I spent time‚Äîit‚Äôs where I made most of my early music. Trevor‚Äôs studio in their home is where my artist project began, and without their love and support, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today.

Unfortunately, the Lanzarottas, along with many others, lost their home and all their belongings in the devastating Eaton Fire. On top of that, the Palisades Fire has also affected countless families, and it‚Äôs hard to truly grasp the scope of the damage and the heartbreak these communities are facing. My heart goes out to each and every family navigating this unimaginable loss.

To support the Lanzarottas, I‚Äôm releasing a new flip. To download it, I‚Äôm asking for a donation‚Äîevery dollar will go directly to their family to help them through this challenging time.

If my music has ever meant something to you, this is an opportunity to give back to the family who made it all possible for me. Every bit of love and support counts, not just for the Lanzarottas, but for all the families impacted by these fires.

Thank you for showing up for them, and for everyone who‚Äôs struggling right now. Your kindness and generosity mean the world. - Connor

These are spaces where laughter once echoed, where stories were shared, and where love and friendship and family grew. 

Seeing it all reduced to ash and wreckage is nothing short of heartbreaking. I witnessed people in the community go and stand in the driveways of what was once their homes, staring at these devastations with a strength I can only admire.

¬†¬†
The AQI measures particulate matter in the air, but it doesn‚Äôt measure their toxicity. The particles and gases in the air right now are much more toxic than normal because they are from burning houses which have all kinds of toxic materials like asbestos, plastic, copper, lead, which we don‚Äôt usually have in our air.
¬†¬†
Around 90% of wildfire smoke is made up of PM2.5 particles.
¬†¬†
PM 2.5 are fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, 30 times smaller than a human hair. Such fine particulate matter is particularly harmful to our health because they can travel deep into the lungs and enter our blood stream, causing everything from inflammation to asthma attacks to sudden cardiac death.
¬†¬†
A recent study smoke exposure from California wildfires between 2008 and 2018 estimated that up to 55,710 premature deaths were attributable to wildfire-related PM2.5 in the air. A link to the study published in¬†Science Advances Journal can be found below.
¬†¬†
As a Los Angeles based herbal company, Dragon Herbs is here to support Angelenos through this unprecedented natural disaster.
¬†¬†
We are giving away 2 free KN95 masks per Angeleno in our West LA/Beverly Hills store. No purchase needed.¬†

KN95 masks¬†are specifically designed and tested to filter out at least 95% PM 2.5¬†particulates in the air.

We have not yet been able to return to check their condition. Most of our volunteers have lost their homes, however. We plan to be active in the very near future as Altadena rebuilds and restores. For the time being, we will be posting (as time permits!) archival images that I have stored on my laptop about 50 miles away from Altadena. We will try to find images of places where we know the current status. By the way, a fraction of our archives have already been digitized and our database is in 'the cloud.' 

This image is of Easter Rock, taken in 1902. Easter Rock looks down on Altadena from high upon the ridge next to Inspiration Point. The fire reached this point, but granite does not burn and the rock still stands. The wooden shelter at Inspiration Point did not survive, unfortunately.

REQUEST:

Hello R2R & Podcast Community,

As many of you know, my wife and I lost our home in the devastating #eatonfire in #altadena last week. 

Along with our home, all my podcasting gear was destroyed in the fire. I‚Äôve been podcasting since 2014 and it has been such a vital aspect of my life. I‚Äôve met incredible friends through podcasting. I‚Äôve had unthinkable experiences like interviewing childhood heroes of mine through podcasting. Podcasting is more than just a hobby, it‚Äôs been the way I‚Äôve been able to creatively express myself through storytelling.

I‚Äôm reaching out to anyone here who might have a spare podcasting mic that they wouldn‚Äôt mind me borrowing/using for the time being.

Over the last few days, I‚Äôve had this internal charge to use my podcasting skills and experience to tell the stories of people from my beloved community of Altadena. 

If there‚Äôs anyway you‚Äôd like to help in this effort, feel free to DM.

You are loved and I feel that same love back at me,

-Max",2025-01-15 20:57:28+00:00

As we take a couple of days to process and regroup, we look forward to another weekend of giving back to the community in LA we love so much. We will be cooking up a storm for @thedreamcenter ‚Äî they are out there doing Gods work üíô

It‚Äôs always been instilled in me to cook with love, but I don‚Äôt think any meal I‚Äôve ever made had more love in it than the meals that went out to fire evacuees and front liners last weekend. I think I can speak for @ongsupernovaong @andreasagx & @jodylu_ who have been volunteering their time to help LA. Love you all. 

Thank you to our donors, you know who you are, who have contributed to making this happen. We‚Äôre excited to partner with a couple vegan protein brands to get as many meals out as possible in the next run so that evacuees and front liners can have access to plant-based food. If you‚Äôre a vegan brand or farm that wants to donate product to us to cook for LA evacuees and front liners, DM meüôèüèº

Thank you to Natalie @sugarpirates for reaching out to me on behalf of @forbes & @forbesadvisors so that insights from the ground can reach 300,000+ more people  who want to direct their money to the tragedy happening in our dear LA. Evacuees want our focus on monetary donations like gift cards of all kinds including Visa gift cards! Newsletter in linked in bio. 

For those of you interested in volunteering, I have linked a couple of resources in my bio: the LA Fire Volunteer Squad on a What‚Äôs App group which links 200 and counting Angelenos dedicated to assisting our community from ways to volunteer on the ground, from home, with donations, animals, housing, etc. 

There is also a google form in my bio where you can sign up to volunteer, right now we need people who can shop for donations needed and dispatchers. Great way to stay informed and involved long term!

The second week of 2025 brought a stark shift from what felt like a smooth start to the new year. Just as we were settling back into life after the holidays, our home of Los Angeles was turned upside down.

I‚Äôm endlessly grateful to be safe, but my heart is with the hundreds of thousands who have been displaced. Many of them are friends, neighbors, and familiar faces in our community. It‚Äôs overwhelming to even imagine the heartbreak of losing everything in an instant.

In times like these, all we can do is show up‚Äîto help, to give, to lift each other up in every way possible.

And that‚Äôs what this city is doing. People from every corner are coming together, as countless heroes continue risking everything to fight these devastating fires.

Los Angeles is resilient. And together, we‚Äôll get through this. 

The first seven slides are photos I saw over the last week. I take no credit for those.

üìç Los Angeles County, California¬†
üóìÔ∏è 2015-present day¬†

I think most of us have felt the same way this past week. We are grieving the loss of our beloved trails, (some) homes, and sadly the loss of life as well. I have kept you all affected by this massive tragedy in my thoughts and prayers. I‚Äôve loved these places now reduced to ashes fiercely and will continue to do so beyond rebuilding and restoring. I whole heartedly pray the road to recovery and rebuilding isn‚Äôt a painful journey but rather a journey filled with hope and light.¬†

Californians this past week have been a light for those who have had to face darkness in this time. I hope that light continues to shine through in the next few days, weeks, months, and years to come. It won‚Äôt be easy but it won‚Äôt be impossible - if you have been affected know you are not alone. There is a community of people doing good and helping hands ready to shine that light. ¬†

‚ô°Ô∏é Will Rogers SP: a place mom and I used over the last 10 years as our retreat from life, a sanctuary to our mental health, and a place that brought us so much joy and peace over the years;¬†

‚ô°Ô∏é Eaton Canyon (Echo Mtn)/Inspiration Point: One of the first hikes that conditioned my legs, my lungs, my mental health before doing peaks;¬†

‚ô°Ô∏é Parker Mesa, Pacific Palisades: where my love for Coastal Hiking grew more intense and where I found friends that helped shape the next few years in my outdoors journey;¬†

‚ô°Ô∏é Mt. Wilson Trail (both via Santa Anita/Sierra Madre Trail and Chantry Flats): The trail that has thought me so much‚Ä¶ frm believing in myself to breaking me down with one of the worst news one can possibly get; 

‚ô°Ô∏é Escondido Canyon: one of my early hikes when I was wearing cute cotton dresses and Keds (I‚Äôve done a whole lot of learning). Later morphing to a beautiful place to bring friends and family for an enjoyable getaway.¬†

These are just a few of the places that have shaped and strengthened me over the years. My heart is with you Los Angeles.

A disaster of this magnitude requires a team effort, and we are immensely grateful to everyone who has stepped in since the fires began last week. We‚Äôre working closely with local officials, government agencies and other nonprofits to coordinate relief efforts and make recovery plans. Red Crossers from across the country are on the ground helping and truckloads of supplies like cots, blankets, water and relief items are available to support thousands of additional people if needed. Donors and partners have given generously to ensure our support of people in need can continue for as long as we're needed. The work is not easy, and demands long days and much effort. But thanks to the many people, partners, agencies and organizations we are privileged to work with, our mission not only continues, but thrives.

Their motto, ""Solo el pueblo salva al pueblo,"" truly shows their commitment with labor and long hours of paid and unpaid work. 

Many of them also lost their jobs because they used to work in the burned areas. However, instead of ignoring the issue, they are helping clean and rebuild the cities of #Pasadena and #Altadena 

Volunteers are also amazing. Just to give you an idea, the center started with 57 volunteers last Thursday and went up to 1,500 volunteers on Saturday and more than 400 volunteers on Tuesday. 

A big shout out too to all the restaurants and organizations that are sending lots of food for these volunteers. I have been there a few days and now I can truly share the sentiment of many. By seeing these efforts, we realize there is so much good in people, and that gives us hope for what comes ahead. 

Do you want to help or need help? Visit them at 500 N. Lake Ave in Pasadena.

I am absolutely heartbroken by the loss of homes, businesses and community in Altadenafrom these fires! And of course everywhere in Los Angeles that was affected. So many of my friends and colleagues have lost homes and small businesses, even family members.

üôèüèºüò•Entire communities are gone. 
I lived in North Pasadena (blocks away from Altadena) in a small bungalow when I first moved to LA. I lived there for 11 years! That street did not get burned but the fire reached within 5 blocks of it! üò≥ü•∫ And during those 11 years I did countless photo shoots in those mountains. As well as attend gatherings and parties at some of the houses in Altadena. Also, hiking at Echo Mountain and Eaton Canyon more times than I can count. Even the community cabin where I did yoga for years‚Ä¶ all of it is gone. I‚Äôm in shock and just devastated. 
I‚Äôve been sharing as much info as I can in my stories and I will tag accounts and I will add as many links as I can in the stories on IG and in comments on FB. 

I have several close friends who need my help and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm personally concentrating on helping. Please help them if you can! If even a small amount to each one, it all adds up!

Given the continuing climate crisis we‚Äôll be pinning a summary of some of the tips our members have found useful from our allies and other organizations. Be sure to check back as we may update our pins!

CAL/OSHA requires employers to reduce workers‚Äô exposure to wildfire smoke and follow certain protocols.

Senate Bill 1044 prohibits retaliation from employers in the case of an employee refusing to work due to an emergency condition (such as an evacuation order). Not all classifications of employees are covered by SB 1044*

Protect your health by staying updated on air quality in your area with airnow.gov.

 Tips for when there is Bad Air Quality:
Limit vigorous physical activity.
Keep windows and doors closed.
Use an N95 or P100 mask outdoors.

Hunter is New York doing work with @nike before heading down to report with pitchers and catchers for spring training in Arizona. It was awesome to talk the man who help develop one of the best players all time to come out of the LA area. He gave my boys such great insight and advice on their development as ball players but also as men off the field. He is all about competition and playing against the best. Russell shared stories how he and Hunter would hand pick tournaments that the top players were going to attend. They did this not just to compete against the best players but to crush them üí™. He is very open and nice so the 2 hours we talked was easy and went by in the blink of eye.

In less than an hour, we were in Pacific Palisades reporting on an epic disaster. We‚Äôve been on the go ever since, also reporting on the tragic losses in Altadena. It‚Äôs been dangerous (thanks to Nate for risking fiery close calls with me), heart stopping and heartbreaking. I‚Äôm too exhausted to reflect or write anything eloquently.

When we built the restaurant about 8 years ago, never in our wildest dreams would we have the honor of being the custodian of a Cleon Peterson masterpiece in our restaurant. 4 large metaphorical warrior figures ferociously guarding our dining room, filling the space with magic. It is a privilege to know and consider him and his family ‚Äì our friends.

Cleon, Kelly, Aubrey, Coco, Huxley and Pepper unfortunately lost their home in the Eaton Fire. This weekend, we spotlight and support the Peterson family as they rebuild their lives. We will be donating a portion of our weekend sale to help their fundraising efforts.

Cleon is also selling a limited edition print (link available on our bio) to fuel their rebuilding efforts. As a current collector of Cleon‚Äôs prints, I can attest that his prints add a lot of substance to any room. 

If you have the capacity to help this incredibly deserving artist get back on his feet- come & dine with us this weekend, we are back open even for brunch and lunch üíï

The Petersons also have a Gofundme where you can contribute directly. Thank you for your support and kindness #denastrong #cleonpeterson #eatonfire #bonekettle",2025-01-15 23:40:39+00:00

Live arts have always been a source of connection and healing, and we‚Äôre eager to play our part in bringing light back to our community. In the days ahead, we‚Äôll be exploring ways to support those affected by the fires, including the artists who enrich our lives with their work.

Together, we endure. Together, we rebuild. And soon, together, we‚Äôll create, laugh, and be inspired once more.

Over 40 years ago, she and her late husband physically built that house in Altadena with their own hands. 

They originally built it because she dreamed of starting a group home for foster care children üíñ

For many years, she fulfilled that dream, providing a loving and supportive family environment to young men who had little or no connection with their biological parentsüôèüèæ

Her home wasn‚Äôt just a house‚Äîit was a safe haven, a place of love, and a foundation for so many cherished memories. From celebrations and family gatherings, and it was always filled with warmth and joy. Recently, she mentioned wanting to host the next family reunion thereü´∂üèæ

Now, that home is gone üò¢ ‚Äîburned to ashes. The family pictures collected over the years, her clothes, her many wigs‚Äîeverything has been lost. 

While we are so grateful for her safety and the memories we hold in our hearts, it‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that the place where she raised her children and grandchildren now exists only in their hearts and minds.

The charter network leader needed to see what remained of his schools.‚Å†
‚Å†
Over the past week, wind-whipped wildfires reshaped wide swaths of Los Angeles, claiming at least 25 lives and destroying more than 12,000 structures. A dozen or more schools have been damaged or destroyed. The danger is not yet past, with fires only partially contained and high winds forecast through Wednesday.‚Å†
‚Å†
Hundreds of thousands of students were out of school last week as more than 1,000 schools across 19 districts announced temporary closures due to poor air quality, shifting evacuation orders, and the many educators, school staff, and student families who had lost their homes.‚Å†
‚Å†
As Garcia Salda√±a approached Odyssey Charter School South, the facade and main entrance appeared intact. But as he looked left and up the hill, he saw a heap of twisted metal and charred rubble where, two days earlier, there had been classrooms, offices, lunch tables, play structures, and an after-school clubhouse. The tree stumps where students used to sit and eat and dream were still smoldering.‚Å†
‚Å†
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just jarring and heartbreaking,‚Äù Garcia Salda√±a said.‚Å†
‚Å†
Now Garcia Salda√±a‚Äôs days are consumed with checking on the many families and staff who lost their homes and looking for a space where students could return to school as soon as possible.‚Å†

Maria has held my hand and lifted my spirit many, many times at my absolute lowest points. I can safely say she is one of the people who helped make it possible for me to serve the way I do today. 

This the gofundme set up for Maria and Mike https://gofund.me/a6dd70c9 and it is legit. Please ONLY use this link for them as, sadly, there are individuals who are exploiting this terrible tragedy. 

As part of the devastation, Maria lost the sacred Sage Spirit Farm which she established in 2020 in the backyard of their home. Browse her website (sagespiritfarm.com) and you will see the extraordinary devotion she brought to the space. Her respect for indigenous history, plant medicine, and practice made her a worthy steward of the task, which she performed with deep reverence, humility, and joy. It‚Äôs so painful to know how much my friends have lost. So many people are hurting and afraid. 

Please consider donating AND sharing. Any amount is most appreciated. Amid this hideous catastrophe, it is so comforting to see the outpouring of support, regardless of the size of the contribution.

When designing the Armcandy for a Cause bracelet to benefit those affected by the wildfires in California, Oriana chose the red howlite bead as a symbol of strength and resilience. Red, a powerful and passionate color, represents the unwavering courage of the communities affected by these devastating events. The fiery hue echoes both the intensity of the wildfires and the indomitable spirit of those who rise from the ashes to rebuild their lives.

The howlite stone, known for its calming properties, complements the boldness of red, signifying balance and hope amidst chaos. By pairing these elements, Oriana created a meaningful piece that embodies not only the struggles faced by these communities but also the strength and solidarity of those coming together to support them. Each bracelet is a reminder that even in the face of devastation, resilience shines through.

The bracelet is adorned with a Pav√© Rainbow charm and an ‚ÄúI‚ù§Ô∏èLA‚Äù / California state charm. The rainbow symbolizes beauty and hope after the storm and serves as a reminder that even after the darkest moments, light and renewal can emerge. Grounding the design in purpose and serving as a heartfelt tribute to the affected region. The charms act as a reminder of the connection between the wearer and the resilient spirit of California‚Äôs people. Paired with howlite beads, known for their calming and grounding properties, the design represents both the perseverance needed to endure challenges and the promise of brighter days ahead while the bracelet becomes a symbol of balance and hope amidst chaos.

Through this thoughtful creation, Oriana crafted a meaningful piece that not only supports recovery efforts but also celebrates the strength, unity, and perseverance of the California community and gives hope to those affected by the wildfires. #HopeForLA  #PrayForLa",2025-01-16 02:06:49+00:00

Emily and her family lost their home last week in the Eaton fire. Today Emily took the courage and shared her story with me. She told me how her family of 9 had to evacuate and leave their home in a matter of minutes during the late night. She told me how they have a little baby in the family and her brother couldn‚Äôt save his belongings because he was focused on saving the babies. Emily told me how her mom was still wearing the same shoes they evacuated with. My heart breaks for them hearing they lost everything. Emily had the courage and strength to share her story with me at only 16 years old. She told me she couldn‚Äôt afford to fall into depression and she has to stay strong for her mom. Emily started their families go fund me page and it is linked in my bio. To some it‚Äôs nothing but to one it‚Äôs everything. I‚Äôm really grateful Emily shared her story with me and I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about her since.

I am thankful that I and my immediate family live and work in the City of Los Angeles which has remained largely unthreatened. But like everyone in the region, I know half a dozen people and counting who have lost their homes, businesses, pets... My magical elementary school, The Pasadena Waldorf School (Altadena), burned. 

So did my former art studio on Boston Street at Lake in Altadena (photos 1-2). (""Former"" because I moved out in 2023 and have been working from home since. I shudder to think of losing my artwork to fire.) This delightfully quirky complex was built by the landlord's father in the 1930s! I found my way there thanks to the ever-generous Shannon @shannonosullivantattoo, director of the Secret Land residency that I enjoyed for the month of October 2021, also in Altadena. SECRET LAND SURVIVED!!! But Shannon and her daughter Rose‚Äôs tattoo studio, SHANGRI-LA TATTOO, was in the Boston Street complex. If you came to my reception at Secret Land, then you can imagine Shangri-La‚Äîit was a transportive den of colors, textures, incense, and walls covered with artwork. (Photos 2-3 from Shannon's IG.) Now Shannon and Rose must find a new home and supplies for their business.

For the month of January, I WILL BE DONATING 40% OF ART SALES TO SHANNON AND ROSE'S GOFUNDME. (40% is the cut that typically goes to a gallery.) To this end, I would especially love to sell art I made at Secret Land and Boston Street. I will be posting those pieces in my stories for the next while, so stay tuned and DM if interested. You can browse other work on my website (link in bio). And of course you can donate directly to the GoFundMe (link in bio). The GoFundMe is 85% of the way to the goal. Let's put it over the top!

My WhatsApp chats are full of people coordinating volunteer and donation efforts. People are welcoming strangers who have lost everything into their homes. Differences that might cause people to avoid each other are falling away. 

The country has been crying with us, and we‚Äôve felt your love and support and fervent prayers for the wind and the flames to stop.

Firefighters from all over the world came to defend our city; the last count I heard was 5000.

On #thisisthewaywednesday, I want to say thank you. And I want to highlight just a few of the ways you can help, whether you are local are far away. I also want to ask you to remember the people who are still struggling from events of 2024 including Hurricane Helene. I am thrilled to hear that my home church in Los Angeles, @cornerstonewla , will be a staging ground for the next few months for @samaritanspurse, an organization that provided tent hospitals in New York City during Covid, remains on the ground for Helene victims, and makes a commitment in all their efforts to stay until the work is done.

THIS IS MORE THAN WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE**üíõ

I‚Äôm not great at promoting myself in the best of times, and this past week has not been anything we could confuse with that. 

But, I will be performing with my genius friend @jasonrobertbrownstagram at the @segerstromarts in Costa Mesa this Thursday 1/16-Saturday 1/18. 

If you live out that way, or don‚Äôt mind the drive and need a break, we‚Äôd love to have you there to interject a little joy into a week where it‚Äôs been literally (asthma and this air quality) and figuratively hard to breathe.

I kept thinking we might cancel, but that‚Äôs not what artists do in times of crisis. We create, and we hope to be able to shift the air with what we do- even when we ourselves are struggling. 

Now, I‚Äôve been blessed to be safe during this wild week, but SO many are living an active tragedy. The only way I could share the info about our show with a clear conscious is also to highlight someone who really needs assistance. 

 So this post is also about the beautiful spirit (please forgive the taciturn looking screenshot) that is @blairimani. ELEVEN of her family members have lost their homes and are now living with her and her husband. This includes 5 children, and several sets of parents. Her 85year old aunt has also lost her home.  All of them from Altadena and Pasadena. They have  lost everything to the Eaton fire. What remains is love, each other and a spirit of perseverance. But they need our help. 

Please visit Blair Imani‚Äôs page, learn more of her story and those of the extended families that moved in with her. And if you have some left to  give after all the giving you‚Äôve already done, please click her go fund me link.

After that, if you want to see an asthmatic and a genius defy the odds this weekend, it would be our great joy to have you at the Samueli theater in the  Segerstrom Arts‚Äô Center. 

With love, blessings, and hope. ‚Ä¶and a few nerves.

Palm in Altadena, a historical treasure, has been mostly destroyed in the Eaton fire. Built in 1915, this stunning example of Churrigueresque architecture was more than just a home‚Äîit was a piece of living history. Its ornate fa√ßade, inspired by the intricate Spanish Baroque style, still stands, but reports confirm that the rest of this architectural gem has been lost.

This home wasn‚Äôt just admired for its beauty‚Äîit was a star in its own right. It first appeared in the 1921 Max Linder silent film Seven Years Bad Luck. Over the decades, it became a favorite filming location for TV and film productions, appearing in Knots Landing, Ratched, and most recently Palm Royale.

Do you know more about the history of this home? Maybe a story, a connection, or even a memory? Let‚Äôs honor its legacy by sharing what we can. Drop your thoughts in the comments below.

Amid concerns over looters targeting wildfire victims‚Äô homes, some residents are defying evacuation orders and choosing to protect their properties instead.

The homeowners said they have chosen to stay put, taking security measures into their own hands while potentially snuffing out any embers that could ignite.

Multiple sources say that the exquisite Casa Andalusia defied the odds and survived! 

Every little bit of good news is greatly appreciated right now, and this is particularly wonderful because this property is stunning and so special! Apparently the house right next to it burned down, but somehow this survived, much like the blue Volkswagon bus! Did you happen to see that? Right in the middle of thousands of houses burned to the ground in Altadena, somehow a Volkswagen bus survived! It seems to have some sort of magical properties that protected it, or so they say. I'm going to look for more information on it but that seemed miraculous, as does this!

Here's to miracles! More about this house: This is the 1926 Casa Andalusia, Spanish Colonial Revival villa with Moorish influences designed by Maurice Swetland, the son of a New York publisher responsible for American Architect magazine. Boasting 5BR/5BA, the half acre estate features original details and period finishes such as Saltillo tile flooring, original wall sconces and original bathroom tile and cathedral-beamed ceilings.

First, I want to thank @losangelesfiredepartment @lapdhq @us.nationalguard and all the #firefighter that came here from around the country and the world to help our city. Luckily, Alex and I have our home and have had power. Our town has been covered in smoke and the air quality has been borderline hazardous. We‚Äôve been sweeping ash off of our cars and balcony. Other communities only 10 miles away have been leveled from the fires. We were just by Sunset and Topanga beach 2 days before the #palisadesfire started and luckily able to enjoy our favorite seafood restaurant @reelinnmalibu one last time. I brought my parents to see Christmas lights in the Upper Hastings Ranch community this last December whose houses are no longer there after being burned by the #eatonfire .

Devastation beyond measure. Heartbreak. Lives, homes, dreams destroyed in flames. Lifetimes of investment gone in a moment. So much loss. I can‚Äôt process it all, but I do know the deep sadness I feel. I am so fortunate to not be directly impacted, so I wonder if I‚Äôm even allowed to be sad. But I do love this city, and the people in it. So I am sad. For the thousands of people who are facing this tragedy, trying to figure out how to move forward and resurrect a life from the ashes. It‚Äôs overwhelming. Of course so is the response. The gratitude for the firefighters and first responders risking their lives to keep us safe. The people who have flown in across state and country lines to help. My industry, my colleagues, working around the clock for days on end to keep people informed. The volunteers. I am amazed and fascinated at the hundreds of ways people are showing up. How vastly different each individual is, with unique talents and capabilities. And how beautiful and powerful  it is when everyone contributes in their own way. Some are cooking, some collecting, others donating, organizing, taking photos, taking in animals, raising funds, sharing stories, driving loads, providing aid, offering childcare, there are SO many different ways that our city is showing up. And each of us crafted in a different way to contribute. I can get overwhelmed by the magnitude of destruction, and feel powerless to stop it. I saw a quote that said something along the lines of doing for one person what you wish you could do for thousands. And I think that‚Äôs a powerful idea. No act of kindness too small. Help one person. Connect someone else that can fill a need. Do what you can with what you have. Small steps, move us forward. I hope and pray that together we will. #lastrong #palisadesfire #eatonfire #abc #abcnews

Coucou les madilous ! C‚Äôest Baby Madison, et aujourd‚Äôhui, je veux vous parler de vrais h√©ros : les pompiers de Jonathanland ! Vous savez, en ce moment, il y a de terribles incendies en Californie, et m√™me si on est loin, √ßa me fait beaucoup r√©fl√©chir. Ici, √† Jonathanland, nos pompiers font tout pour prot√©ger les habitants et notre belle nature, et je trouve qu‚Äôils m√©ritent tous nos applaudissements ! üëè

Hier, on est pass√©s pr√®s de la caserne avec maman et papa, et j‚Äôai vu plein de camions rouges pr√™ts √† partir en mission. C‚Äô√©tait impressionnant ! J‚Äôai demand√© √† maman pourquoi il y avait autant de pompiers partout, et elle m‚Äôa expliqu√© qu‚Äôils travaillent tr√®s dur pour contenir les feux de for√™t et √©viter qu‚Äôils ne s‚Äô√©tendent. Vous savez quoi ? Ces pompiers sont comme des super-h√©ros, mais en vrai ! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ils n‚Äôont pas de capes, mais ils ont des casques brillants, des grands tuyaux qui arrosent tout, et surtout un courage √©norme ! Maman dit qu‚Äôils risquent leur vie pour sauver les autres, les animaux, et m√™me les arbres. Moi, je trouve √ßa tellement beau.
Aujourd‚Äôhui, j‚Äôai pris mon petit carnet pour dessiner un camion de pompier (avec des roues bien rondes et des √©chelles qui montent jusqu‚Äôau ciel). Je vais leur offrir mon dessin pour leur dire merci. Et vous, les amis, vous avez une id√©e pour leur montrer votre soutien ? Pourquoi ne pas leur √©crire un petit mot ou juste leur dire merci quand vous les croisez ? üìù

On a de la chance d‚Äôavoir des gens aussi formidables √† Jonathanland. Alors, un grand BRAVO aux pompiers ! Vous √™tes nos √©toiles brillantes, m√™me quand la fum√©e cache le ciel. üåü

Gros bisous et une grosse pens√©e pour les victimes du feu. ‚ù§Ô∏è

A #GoFundMe has been set up to support displaced Black victims of the  Eaton Fireüî•. üîó to give in bio.

Physical donations are also being accepted in South Los Angeles at Prince Hall, 9027 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, CA 90003. Items needed include blankets and pillows, clothing of all sizes, undergarments, toiletries/essentials, children‚Äôs toys and games, phone chargers, extension cords, and adult and children‚Äôs diapers. 

Attorneys for California‚Äôs two largest Black firms have united to create a fund to help displaced Black victims of the Eaton Fire.  The Cochran Firm and Ivie McNeil Wyatt Purcell and Diggs, along with The Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Masons State of California Inc., have established an official and trusted GoFundMe campaign where 100% of the funds raised will be used to assist the victims impacted in the Pasadena/Altadena Community.

The impact on these Black residents has been devastating as a large population of these families has lost everything. Furthermore, many of these homes that were burned in the fires were not insured for fire disasters, whether it be due to insurance companies who recently canceled thousands of fire insurance policies in the past few months, or owners who simply did not have fire insurance as it was not required because the property did not have a mortgage. 
 
A large portion of the nearly 20,000 Black residents are displaced, with nowhere to go other than temporary shelters. Due to the fact that a number of the older residents were on fixed incomes, whether they were homeowners, renters, or living in one of the assisted living facilities, that were destroyed, this sensitive population is left completely at risk.

Please donate and share. Link in bio.

Hi everyone. I was personally affected by the Eaton Fire as I live in Altadena, CA. I have been evacuated, as have many of my family and friends (our homes are full of toxic dust), and my aunt lost her home, along with many others in the foothills of LA. I am launching a T-shirt campaign to raise money for people who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please consider supporting @rosefromtheashes_eatonüåπ

I'm so grateful my wife Bridget saved it before I got back from shooting the Palisades Fire as it wouldn't have survived, even in that safe. I inherited it from my father when he passed last year and neither of us felt comfortable wearing it - it's the exact same watch Tony Soprano wore after all -  but right now I feel the safest place for it may be on my wrist. It also gives me a sense of connection to a man I barely new, but who also lost his home to wildfire in the 1961 Bel Air Fire. #eatonfire #palisadesfire #lafires #belairfire 

thank you to @losangeleswatchworks for helping me get the band back on so I don't misplace it in the midst of all this chaos.",2025-01-16 14:06:33+00:00

sharing here the limited images i have taken since the new year. still in shock at how quickly life can transform.  plus a tribute to one of my patron saints - joan didion - from her book where i was from ‚Äúwe have seemed capable of almost anything in california. these unusual people in this extraordinary place come equipped with vitality and with dreams. in california it is not yet too late.‚Äù 

community is everything to me and watching our city rise up for one another immediately, even while everyone pieces through their own lives is an inspiring lighthouse through this darkness. countless big companies have remained silent, shockingly so, while the heroic efforts of countless individuals, community organizers, and companies has been astounding. we have shown up.  my trauma response is to get to work, to keep moving, to help every human that i possibly can. that‚Äôs the activist spirit of my core being and what i will continue to do. thank you to the incredible, generous humans - those that i know and total strangers and brands - who have answered every call, text, and dm at all hours of the day for my endless requests for relief and donations, big and small.  life takes a village, and ours has shown up in ways that i never imagined. the love brings tears to my eyes every single day. 

we have a long road ahead, so this will be a regular practice that we need to collectively stay engaged and connected.  live your life with intention and think about how you can support los angeles makers, creatives, restaurants, businesses, and parents - every single human in our city needs you.  not just today, but for the weeks and months and years as we emerge from the rubble.

Many of the contaminants found in the fires can also be found in your homes, just through different objects and home furnishings.

Some exposures are completely unavoidable, but how we handle them and support our bodies along with our dogs, is the key.

antioxidant supports that combat free radicals (all of our supports), what we‚Äôve shared before about calcium bentonite clay, and natural every day daily practice of healthy living, is where the micro makes the macro.

We are about 80 miles from the #EatonFire and 100 miles from the #PalisadesFire, so we were never in danger from those thank goodness. We did have several fires pop up closer to home during the Red Flag Warnings, but they were all extinguished quickly. The firefighters have done SUCH an amazing job, we are forever grateful. 

To all who have lost a home, a loved one, a school, a business, my heart goes out to you. Los Angeles is made of strong, resilient, determined people, so if anyone can get through this, it's LA. You will all continue to be in my thoughts. 

If you have the ability to donate, I'm including a fundraiser for @wckitchen to help feed victims and fire crews in the affected areas. #LAstrong #California #CaliforniaStrong

I keep looking at the photos in my camera roll over the span of the last 2 & 1/2 years and I feel so grateful for all of the spontaneous trips to socal and for all of the pictures that I took along the way. 
For some reason, I have found so much healing in being able to skip town for a few days to be able find beautiful little pockets of peace throughout the city. 
This was, by far-my favorite trip. We were supposed to go to Mendocino, but plans changed. We found the most magical beach in the Palisades and I captured the cutest photos of my girls. They look like little coppertone babies. I am so grateful for these memories. 
My mind keeps thinking about all of the young children and teens that have been impacted by the fires. 
@altadenagirls was started by a teenage girl to raise awareness of the importance to keeping self identity and self care a priority amongst the chaos. Having a sense of control of one small thing can help maintain focus and positive healing in a child‚Äôs life.
As a mother who shares custody of her children, I understand how important it is for children to have structure, routine and consistency during a time of crisis, change and rebuilding.
Please follow their page and consider donating what you can.
The children are our future. ‚ÄúTeach them well and let them lead the way‚Ä¶‚Äù

Earth, Air, Fire, Water. The Ancients named and worshiped these 4 Elements, as Gods, great Forces of Nature. Sometimes they show us how powerful they are. But we keep the faith, and no matter what, our Fifth Element is Aether. The Transcendent All, the Nature of Nature, and That Is Love. 

You Are What Remains. 

It‚Äôs What We Do Now That Matters. 

Our Heart Goes Out to all those affected by the fires. 

There has been such poignant sadness disappointment and loss. Our news is often focused on moving from one tragedy to another; we feel compassion, still the near ceaseless immensity of suffering and rote presentation can be numbing. Gaza, the Congo, Tibet just had a devastating earthquake. Plus, every day homes are lost to fires that receive far less attention, yet the impact for the individuals affected is just as profound. Yes, there is something extra felt when it hits close to home, or even perhaps home. We resonate with what we identify with, sympathetic magic. The Ancients also say‚Ä¶. 

Life is for Learning and Every Lesson Ultimately is About Compassion and Sympathy and bridging the illusion of division with Love. Ethereal. Let this tragedy continue to allow us to open our eyes and hearts to those around us. To life, to what really matters. 

We pray for easy lessons and grace. May the forces of nature have mercy. Take it easy on us all; and LA could use a break. Yet we are all still so lucky. Life is a blessing and a journey. 
We wish you well. The Awoken Space is open again, and here to help.

Please stay tuned, we have many exciting offerings in store. 

Life is still beautiful, the Sun will Rise, the Moon will Shine, things will keep getting better, and better. 

Peace,

I loved writing so much I‚Äôd enter essay contests, speech competitions, write poetry‚Ä¶but eventually I convinced myself I had to do something that made more sense. Something where I could make my work and my impact more linear.

20 years later, I look at this photo, unedited, and I‚Äôm reminded of the fact that when I started to pursue photojournalism, it was a glimpse of me pursuing my gift. Over the past few years, I reignited that passion through telling the stories of local businesses and connecting with families and neighbors for my real estate business. 

On one of my hikes through Chaney Trail in December, it became so clear to me that my platform needed to become a neighborhood time capsule, but I wasn‚Äôt sure where or how to start. 

Then the wind came. Then the fire came. And our lives were forever changed. This devastation has made an imprint upon history and we‚Äôre at the center. 

The story can be told as a whole, but the story would be incomplete. Like a painting, each intricate stroke is what creates the masterpiece. Like a tapestry, each thread is just as important as the next. And so are our stories. The story of Altadena cannot be told and our history cannot be preserved without acknowledging the people, the details which make us whole. 

And so, we have reached the climax of our story, where the future can be uncertain. But the resonating sentiment that lives inside each member of our town is that we will rise from the ashes and what was gone will never be lost. And we will tell our stories.

Seeing the devastation caused by the fires and hearing the stories of those impacted has been truly heartbreaking. Like many of you, I‚Äôve been feeling a mix of emotions ‚Äì sadness, anger, helplessness... and a deep sense of gratitude for the firefighters and first responders who are working tirelessly to keep us safe.

This experience has really driven home the importance of community and the power of human connection. It‚Äôs been incredible to see how people are coming together to support each other, whether it‚Äôs through donations, volunteering, or simply offering a shoulder to cry on.

I‚Äôve been pretty quiet on social media this past week. I recognize that all of us process things differently, but posting my work amidst such loss and grief, initially felt insensitive and tone deaf. But then I realized that sharing beauty and joy is also a way to offer comfort and hope. And, let‚Äôs be real, keeping my business going means I can continue to donate and support the relief efforts.

In the meantime, if you or someone you know has lost their home in the wildfires, please reach out. I‚Äôd love to offer a complimentary portrait session.  While there is no way to replace the memories lost, I would love to play a small role in helping you create some new memories.

It is hard to believe that today already marks 9 days since we had to evacuate from the #eatonfire, and 8 since we lost our home in #altadena. 

During periods of loss and trauma, the concept of time is immensely elusive; the time between now and those moments mentioned above both seem like decades apart and as if it happened only 5 minutes ago. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

Good NEWS! ‚Ä®‚Ä®

Max, Jasmine, Tim and of course Charlie, currently have a short term living situation that is more than ideal! ‚Ä®‚Ä®

Thanks to our friends who pastor a church in Burbank, we are staying in a dorm-style-living apartment in the heart of Burbank on their campus! The living situation is absolutely perfect because we have our own rooms, own dining and living space, shared kitchen AND Charlie can be with us too! ‚Ä®‚Ä®

The love and hospitality from this church congregation has been added to the large bucket of overwhelming support we‚Äôve experienced so far in this journey.‚Ä®‚Ä®

The Ongoing:‚Ä®‚Ä®
Every day thus far is spent on the phone, computer or in person searching for resources, receiving benefits and inquiring about next steps for how to recover from our loss. We visited the Disaster Relief Center, connected with FEMA and all the county resources. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

All to say, the services provided have been incredibly helpful in navigating our next steps! ‚Ä®We‚Äôre so thankful for all who have emailed, texted and DM‚Äôed us on valuable information. Keep them coming! ‚Ä®‚Ä®

Next Steps:

We are still in need of a long term stay as we look to rebuild. As hard as it may be, our desire is to be within 15 miles of Altadena. We are hopeful and optimistic that this will materialize. ‚Ä®Looking for a 3 bedroom, 2 bath that allows a large dog. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

Such loss. The unprecedented fire disaster, tragic evacuations and rescues, brings back emotions of Hurricane Katrina days. I evacuated the French Quarter late; my friends couldn't leave at the same time. My second car for them to escape in got locked down at the closed dealership, where I had taken it in for service. After the storm, NOLA cell phones towers were dead and people couldn't communicate, to find one another. This Palm Beach Daily News (Shiny Sheet) article and photo shows the exact moment many days later I learned my friends were safe. A Good Samaritan got them and their dog out before epic flood swamped our city, and they were sheltering in Texas. 

Having had a second home in the French Quarter of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, I have a unique understanding of the horrific loss of one's home and neighborhood and town, the emotional toll of such a tragedy, and how it also feels to be ""one of the lucky ones"" whose house is left standing amid ruin. 

Rebuilding California post-fires is expected to top $250 billion. It will be an exhaustive and long process, sadly, over the course of many years. Many Los Angeles residents may initially or ultimately relocate to other areas, by choice or by circumstance. 

In terms of the costliest US ""natural disasters"" ever, the most expensive to date have all been hurricane events. The most expensive by far was Hurricane Katrina, the devastating 2005 tropical cyclone which led to massive loss of life, levy breaks, flooding & economic damage, particularly in the southern city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The Gulf Coast of Mississippi was also wiped out. Estimated insured losses alone for Hurricane Katrina were just shy of $200 billion and 1,833 fatalities. With that said, those who went thru Katrina, and the years afterward, rarely agree with the death count.

Altadena, one of the few historic Black communities spared from redlining, deserves racial equity in recovery efforts. Yet families are left pleading for help as insurance companies deny claims and government aid remains absent.

The #EatonFire highlights the urgent need for reparations for Black Californians. Without meaningful action from state and local governments, our communities must rely on solidarity and mutual aid instead of systemic justice. Black families have fought to preserve their generational homes, but systemic failures continue to strip them away. The victims of the Eaton Fire in Altadena have received far less media coverage and donations compared to those impacted by fires in Palisades. Many Black Altadena families are now turning to GoFundMe, desperately seeking support after being abandoned by their insurance providers.

We‚Äôve linked verified campaigns in our LinkTree (in bio üîó) so you can directly support Altadena families who have lost everything.

Our team has compiled a list of resources and ideas of how to support our students in times of crisis, especially in their own community.

When beginning to navigate these conversations, acknowledge your children‚Äôs feelings and your own. Reassure them that it is natural to feel what they are feeling.  Let them know that they are cared for and safe.

Keep the language simple and age-appropriate. Avoid extraneous details and focus on the heroic efforts of the helpers and first responders. Highlight how neighbors are working together to make things better. If you are in the position to do so, talk about ways your family can join in these community efforts.

Maintain routines wherever possible. A sense of normalcy can be calming for everyone in times of crisis. 

We are sending so much love and support to our LA community. If you need support, please reach out. Remember, you can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup.  Take care of yourselves and your families, and let us know how we can assist you.  We are here to help.

Among his best known works is Riders of the Purple Sage, a novel complete with gun fights and horse thieves that would set the tone for Westerns to this day.‚Å†
‚Å†
The Zane Grey estate was designed by the prolific partnership of Myron Hunt and Elmer Grey, and first completed in 1907 for Arthur Herbert Woodward, a wealthy Chicago business man, and his wife, Edith, in the early Mediterranean Revival style. Edith, a survivor of the deadly 1903 Chicago Iroquois Theater Fire, ensured that Hunt and Grey designed home was completely fireproof, making it the first fireproof home constructed in Altadena. Sadly, the home‚Äôs concrete construction could not save it from the flames of the Eaton Fire. ‚Å†
‚Å†
The Grey family would purchase the home in 1920 and add a third floor studio and library for Grey‚Äôs creative endeavors. I‚Äôm especially saddened by the loss of this aerie, with its massive beams and intricately carved woodworkings. ‚Å†This would have been a perfect writing place, and I hope a similar space can be recreated in the future.‚Å†
‚Å†
Head over to @etandoesla and @saveiconicarchitecture for more great insights into this historic home. ‚Å†

When the evacuation order for the Eaton Fire was issued, I didn‚Äôt pack much except for a framed photo of my partner and me, as well as my two most prized possessions, my cameras, and with Chloe, our tortie cat in tow. 

As we drove away, I quickly glanced up at the burning sky and captured this photograph. It made me contemplate the fragility of our existence. Tomorrow is not a guarantee; everything we know may and will disappear one day. So, what do we hold onto? What do we make space for? That‚Äôs what this photo is meant to highlight. Tomorrow will rise again only if we believe in it. That persistence and perseverance start with us. This is a reminder to not lose our hope and fight, against all odds.

One morning, you wake up, go through your usual routine, and drive your child to school. On the way, you get a message that school is canceled due to high winds. If you have kids, you know how frustrating a last-minute cancellation can be.

In the next 24 hours, our town, my daughter‚Äôs school, our house, everything we owned‚Äîincluding our car‚Äîwould be gone. This was my family‚Äôs reality on January 7th.

Asking for help is deeply uncomfortable for me‚Äîit goes against my nature. I think many people, especially in our community, feel the same way. But if I‚Äôve learned anything from @QueerEye (my daughter Isa‚Äôs favorite show), it‚Äôs that asking for help when you need it is vital for growth, healing, and moving forward.

My family doesn‚Äôt know what the road ahead looks like, but we do know this: we will dream new dreams. We will move forward with strength, laughter, grace, and above all, love.

If you‚Äôre able to help, I‚Äôve included links to support our next-door neighbors, an amazing family who have been the heart of our street, and my daughter‚Äôs school (Aveson).

Hi Friends ~ Just an update as I've gotten so many emails from people checking on me, sending love, asking how I am...

So many different feelings and thoughts‚Ä¶ waves of grief. Friends in Altadena, sending me pictures once their house shows up on the recovery page and they can see the actual remnants of what was their home.¬†

Amazingly the place I lived for over 10 years when I first moved here in the Altadena Meadows I thought would‚Äôve burned, but it has not. Maybe because it‚Äôs close to JPL/NASA, there has been tremendous protection. A lot around it has burned, but that little no outlet road that was my first home in California on Canyon Crest is still standing. Even though I don‚Äôt live there now for some reason, I feel relieved.

I‚Äôve been feeling more and more comfortable back at my home and then last night coming in with Lily I came in the back way and I looked down at the pool. And some part of my brain went, ‚ÄúOh ‚Äî that‚Äôs the debris from the fire that hasn‚Äôt been cleaned yet. Oh, this is really happening.‚Äù And I noticed I just felt numb. And that I noticed that I was noticing this. So I think that‚Äôs progress from just being swept up in everything.

I‚Äôm not feeling the adrenaline I had yesterday, but I am noticing how quickly my body just zones out, goes numb, which tells me it‚Äôs still overwhelmed. I‚Äôm still overwhelmed.¬†

So‚Ä¶I‚Äôm resting and rebuilding the momentum of peace and appreciation and love that is my normal mode of being while, keeping my heart and energy field open and doing what I can to not numb out and when I notice I have, to come back to the present moment. And look for things that confirm that I am safe. (Continued)",2025-01-16 19:23:14+00:00

Standing here with my partner Aarya Kapoor, we are reminded of just how fragile life is. The wildfires of Los Angeles are not just a disaster; they're a fight for survival, a battle for everything we hold dear. Today, the Eaton fire has already claimed the lives of at least 17 people, and thousands of families are being displaced as the flames continue to spread. üå™Ô∏è The fire has already become the deadliest in California this year, and the destruction is only growing.

üíî As firefighters, we don‚Äôt just put on our gear because it‚Äôs our job; we do it because we believe in saving lives, protecting homes, and standing tall when everyone else might run. Right now, the winds are howling at speeds of over 70 mph, and temperatures are dangerously high, pushing us to our limits. Yet we continue because the stakes are too high.

The international support has been incredible‚Äîfirefighters from Canada and Mexico have joined the fight alongside us. üåç They‚Äôve helped us create a united front, showing that in times of crisis, we rise together. The fire may be destroying everything in its path, but it cannot destroy our will to fight.

This battle is far from over, and every day brings new challenges. But I want to remind all of you that there is hope in the darkest moments. We may face destruction, but together we will rebuild. üåü Aarya and I, alongside all first responders, are here doing everything we can to protect Los Angeles. We‚Äôre in this together.

To everyone out there who has supported us‚Äîyour messages, donations, and words of encouragement keep us going. üôè Thank you for your unwavering belief in us. Stay safe, stay strong, and remember‚Äîhope is always on the horizon. üåÖ

I‚Äôve put together a  doc with what exactly you need to do to get these services and read through the fine print to make it easier to find what you need.

Him and I have had the opportunity to work on some pretty epic projects together from Black History Month to Black Fashion Week in San Diego and beyond.

This time around is our most important collab yet. 

Henry was born and raised in the Altadena/Pasadena area. 

His extended family has lost 3 of 5 of their family homes to the #EatonFire

Being the incredible activist that he is, he rose to the occasion and from day 1 has set up a resource center for families impacted.

His grassroots action is serving approximately 300 people per day.

Hot meals, clothes, hygiene kits, water, masks, and the list goes on.

Grassroots activism will always have my heart and it will always be the way.

Community is going to save the planet.

Community takes action long before government does.

I've been doing what I can to resource and supplement his efforts. 

Organizing various food vendors, suitcases, hygiene kits, etc from my community to support his.

I've also donated money and I'm encouraging others to do the same, if you can.

Altadena is a historically Black community.

Supporting these grassroots efforts is essential to seeing this community restored.

Friday will be one of the most epic days yet of this labor of love.

We will be partnering with @feherlawapc , LA favorites @bartz.barbecue and @sprinkledcookie 

This will be an opportunity for those impacted in the area to get vital resources, eat a hot and delicious meal,  get a sweet treat, share in community 

AND

we will be raffling off FOUR Los Angeles Dodgers  tickets!

What do we need from you?

Any and all hands to show up and volunteer!

Financial donations (link in bio)

suitcases and tote bags

Water and Hygiene Kits

It was shocking to see the damage in person, but there were some really hopeful takeaways I‚Äôd like to share.  The home is located just over 2 miles from the origin of the Eaton Fire, and luckily survived the blaze(a newly reshingled roof may have been a big contributing factor) while sadly many of their neighbors homes were destroyed.  Fire tore up from the hillside in their backyard and sent projectiles soaring across the sky raining down on the neighborhood.  This hillside was densely populated with invasive species, which quickly burned‚Ä¶however, the native trees and shrubs that made up most of the canopy survived! Coast Live Oak, Toyon and Elderberry were all scorched, blackened around their bases, the leaves shriveled and sad‚Ä¶but, GREEN.  These plants will more than likely recover.  So stoked to see this small but significant example of the resilience of native plants among all the devastation.  #hardycalifornians #eatonfire",2025-01-16 20:23:02+00:00

But this home, designed by architect Greg Chasen, survived thanks to smart design choices and fire-resistant materials. üè° üí™üèº

Here‚Äôs how it withstood the flames:

‚úÖ Fire-Safe Materials
* ü™µ Fire-resistant wood: special heat-blocking layers behind the walls and heat-treated siding helped prevent flames from spreading.
* üõ°Ô∏è A metal roof with fire-resistant underlayment stopped embers from penetrating.
* ü™ü Tempered glass windows didn‚Äôt shatter under extreme heat, keeping fire and smoke out.
* üåæ Defensible space: No vegetation near the house + concrete garden walls.

‚úÖ Smart Design
* üö´ No eaves, overhangs, or attic vents that could let sparks in.
* üîí Airtight construction stopped embers from sneaking inside.
* üå¨Ô∏è Special ventilation systems filtered out smoke, keeping the air safe to breathe.

This home shows what‚Äôs possible with thoughtful home design and a focus on resilience. It‚Äôs also inspired me on my own journey to build a wildfire-resilient, solar-powered home in San Diego. üå±‚òÄÔ∏è

After seeing wildfires devastate my hometowns of Sonoma County and Lahaina, I‚Äôve spent the past three years learning how to design a home that can withstand the challenges of California wildfires. It hasn‚Äôt been easy, but it‚Äôs going to be worth it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

Let‚Äôs build homes that protect lives and communities. üí™üèºüè°‚ú®

Rossini Canyon, a property in Cardiff-by-the-Sea owned by state Sen. Catherine Blakespear (D-Encinitas), has drawn several complaints in recent years about potential fire hazards posed by more than 40 dead palm trees and mounds of dried fronds on the site. 

In a statement sent to The Coast News, Blakespear said a community effort was planned this weekend to address the fire hazard and clear years of withered palm fronds and deadfall.

‚ÄúWe recognize this creates a fire danger, and we‚Äôll be working Saturday to remove them,‚Äù Blakespear said. ‚ÄúWe encourage participation from surrounding neighbors to work together collectively to reduce risk in a space that has been enjoyed by many neighbors for years.‚Äù

Neighboring residents like Lance Cummings, whose home borders Rossini Canyon, have described the dead palms and up to 20-foot high piles of brown, desiccated fronds as ""Roman candles waiting for a spark,"" posing a severe fire risk to the surrounding 50 homes in the densely packed neighborhood.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been nothing done at all, and those fronds just sit there and dry out,‚Äù Cummings said. ‚ÄúThe palm trees don't get a lot of water. They have a lot of oil in their fronds and probably burn quicker and easier than any other tree, especially after sitting around for two years.‚Äù

Our final report from California for the evening news has in it a few of the good and brave people we met in Altadena. 

Julian, who is more concerned about his wife than the home they no longer have; Henry R. Jones II @henryrjonesii, who rushed back to his childhood community to do everything he could to help; and Rosa, working tirelessly with a list of 110+ families, trying to provide them with what they need. Food, clothes, bags and toys. 

Seven days with a lot of grief and sadness. But also a week filled with a great amount of kindness, in the midst of the most horrible disaster.

Eaton fire broke out, my home lost power. We could see the flames from our front doorstep, the air turned thick, and we began rounding up the kitties.

But my initial displacement and subsequent safety is as much as I‚Äôd shared publicly before @instituteforanimalhappiness surprised me with a grocery gift card. They had no way of knowing that in addition to our property damage from the strong winds, all of our groceries eventually spoiled due to power loss, or that I was actually feeling quite stressed about it all. I certainly wanted to avoid making myself the main character in a city-wide tragedy that affects everyone in a multitude of ways, especially as the ripple effects of health complications, competition for housing, rising rents, ‚Äústrained resources‚Äù, and an increased unhoused population emerge‚Äîespecially for Black and Brown communities.

So I‚Äôm just here to express gratitude. Immense gratitude. The type that any words fall short to capture.

Standing shoulder to shoulder with my partner, Aarya Kapoor, amidst the relentless wildfires in Los Angeles, we're reminded of the fragility of life and the strength of community. The Palisades Fire, now the city's most devastating wildfire, has tragically claimed at least 27 lives, with 36 individuals still unaccounted for. Over 170,000 residents have been evacuated, and more than 10,230 structures have been reduced to ashes.

üíî Each loss is a profound reminder of our mission's importance. The challenges are immense, with hurricane-force Santa Ana winds reaching up to 100 mph and severe drought conditions fueling the infernos. Yet, our resolve remains unshaken. Firefighters from Mexico, Canada, and the Navajo Scouts have joined us, exemplifying international solidarity in the face of disaster.

Recent weather forecasts bring a glimmer of hope, predicting improved conditions that may aid our firefighting efforts.

üôè To our community: Your unwavering support, from heartfelt messages to generous donations, fuels our determination. Together, we will rebuild, heal, and emerge stronger. Stay safe, remain vigilant, and hold onto hope. üåü

‚ÄúOn the night before the devastating Eaton fire broke out and as the Santa Ana winds were gusting, this little cutie was discovered by a colony feeder at the Trader Joe‚Äôs in Hastings Ranch (Pasadena). Friendly and affectionate, she came running out of the nearby brush when the feeder arrived, essentially begging for a rescue.

Jinkx is approximately 10 weeks old and will be delivered vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, FIV/FeLV tested, spayed, and ideally with her BFF Apple Pie.‚Äù

Carolina Ramirez-Sanchez stands in the rubble of her home of 21 years, a house her immigrant parents worked tirelessly to purchase so their children could grow up with stability.

The 34-year-old lived there with her parents, husband, two daughters, three siblings and two dogs. ‚ÄúWe never wanted to leave our parents,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy father would always say to me, ‚ÄòI help you, and one day you will help me.‚Äô‚Äù

Now, her father‚Äôs words resonate more than ever. As the caregiver for her 63-year-old parents, Sanchez has faced the heartbreak of seeing her family of nine split up to live with relatives and friends while figuring out next steps. Her father has returned to see the ruins of their home, but her mother cannot bring herself to face it.

‚ÄúI feel numb at this point,‚Äù Sanchez said. ‚ÄúI keep coming back, wanting to see it one last time. I just want my bed, my books, the comfort of my home.‚Äù

In the image we see a firefighter hosing down a home with one hand while comforting a frightened dog with the other. I‚Äôm sure you know the one. 

Let me introduce you to Slater Lee from Oceanside San Diego, who has been working with his crew to help contain the Eaton Fire. Rest assured, Max the dog is doing well, thanks to @klutch_k9 and other good people. 

On Monday night, @thomasmachowicz and I were in the Altadena neighborhood when we met another firefighter and told him we were documenting animal rescues. He led us to the edge of a ridge and pointed to bright lights in a field below and said, ‚ÄúYou want to tell a story about animal rescue? The guy in the photo with the dog is right down there giving an interview.‚Äù He showed us the way on a map, and thirty minutes later we were meeting Slater and his crew. I interviewed Slater on the fly, and we all shared some laughs and heartfelt conversation. Everyone was excited to hear that our storytelling focus is compassion for animals. 

Over the next few weeks, I‚Äôll be posting images from my three full days on assignment with @sanctuary_doc - most likely at a slow pace. Taking time to process the experience and reflect on the extraordinary efforts of those on the ground feels essential right now as I work on a longer form story.

I hope the images take you there and offer you hope amidst the heartbreak. 

Stay strong LA, and thank you Slater for offering not just one helping hand, but two.

This cherished neighborhood, known for its rich history and unique architecture, has been a cornerstone of our community for generations.

Jane‚Äôs Village, named after Jane Bardwell, was a collection of quaint, English-style cottages built in the 1920s and 1930s. These storybook homes, with their steeply pitched roofs, arched doorways, and handcrafted details, were not just houses‚Äîthey were works of art, lovingly preserved by residents committed to maintaining their historic charm.

This neighborhood represented a tangible connection to a bygone era, where craftsmanship and character were paramount. Its loss is a sobering reminder of how fragile history can be. As we move forward, let us honor the memory of Jane‚Äôs Village by advocating for the preservation of other historic landmarks in our region.

Together, we can rebuild, but the soul of what was lost will live on in our hearts.

If interested in my personal experience this week as a Pasadena resident, you can read on below.

‚Äî‚Äî

From a distance, I watched the tragedy of the Maui fires unfold in August of 2023, shook to my core. Feeling helpless for the locals and the island‚Äôs beauty. While it wasn‚Äôt my own family on Oahu fleeing their homes, it hit just as close to home‚Ä¶ 

Up close last week, I experienced the Eaton Fire, evacuating with my new family from Pasadena when they received a mandatory order on Tuesday evening. Packing like we‚Äôd perhaps never have the opportunity of returning home, too. The wild winds unlike anything we‚Äôd ever seen or felt before ‚Äî making any type of destruction seem possible, and making it feel like a true MIRACLE when we woke up the next morning to find my in-laws‚Äô home was spared while others in their neighborhood burned. Their direct neighbor‚Äôs, the grandparents, and our home all safe too. We stayed glued to the news, seeing each of our street names highlighted in live footage of burning homes and businesses. Holding our breaths. Crying (personally).

On television, Alex and I watched as the fire broke out at Runyon Canyon ‚Äî my sisters‚Äô street name also plastered across the screen. Frantically calling and urging them to evacuate from Hollywood. Tracking their location closely until they were safely at a distance. Then, returning to our neighborhoods this weekend to the sobering reality of the loss and devastation. The landscapes forever changed. The businesses we‚Äôd frequent. The people who lost their physical everything.

It is hard to believe that today already marks 9 days since we had to evacuate from the #eatonfire, and 8 since we lost our home in #altadena. 

During periods of loss and trauma, the concept of time is immensely elusive; the time between now and those moments mentioned above both seem like decades apart and as if it happened only 5 minutes ago. 

Good NEWS! ‚Ä®
Max, Jasmine, Tim and of course Charlie, currently have a short term living situation that is more than ideal! ‚Ä®

Thanks to our friends who pastor a church in Burbank, we are staying in a dorm-style-living apartment in the heart of Burbank on their campus! The living situation is absolutely perfect because we have our own rooms, own dining and living space, shared kitchen AND Charlie can be with us too! ‚Ä®

The love and hospitality from this church has been added to the large bucket of overwhelming support we‚Äôve experienced so far in this journey.‚Ä®

The Ongoing:‚Ä®
Every day thus far is spent on the phone, computer or in person searching for resources, receiving benefits and inquiring about next steps for how to recover from our loss. We visited the Disaster Relief Center, connected with FEMA and all the county resources. 

All to say, the services provided have been incredibly helpful in navigating our next steps! ‚Ä®We‚Äôre so thankful for all who have emailed, texted and DM‚Äôed us on valuable information. Keep them coming! ‚Ä®

Next Steps:

We are still in need of a long term stay as we look to rebuild. As hard as it may be, our desire is to be within 15 miles of Altadena. We are hopeful and optimistic that this will materialize. ‚Ä®Looking for a 3 bedroom, 2 bath that allows a large dog. ‚Ä®

Thank you for your love, support and prayers!

-Max

Pop-up hours: 12 pm - 3 pm

10% of all sales in January & February will go towards the Fire Mutual aid efforts.

Free Bentos for first responders & evacuees.
Please DM to confirm so I can have it ready. It can be anytime anywhere I can reasonably access for delivery. You do NOT need to come to a pop-up to pickup, but if you‚Äôd prefer to do so, I still need to have a heads up as I may not have enough stock or the proper menu items to make a bento.

Also, see my last video on our volunteer work with  @shopquirkla They have a lot of resources ready to go to those impacted by the fires. Essential toiletries, disposables, baby formula & diapers, and especially CLOTHES. Specially curated by industry stylists, personal shoppers, and professionals to help rebuild wardrobes with dignity. See their page for hours and items available as well as volunteer and donation opportunities.

We also picked up a sizable amount in good condition of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs tees, sweats, and thin sweaters for anyone looking for some comfy clothes to stay warm in. We also have 2 beautiful long puffer jackets. If anyone is interested, DM me. I can have it sent along with your free bentos.

Mike Bidart and Riccardo Echeverria at the Shernoff Bidart firm in Claremont are the gold standard as far as property coverage and making insurance companies fulfill their obligations under the bad faith laws is concerned. Rahul Ravipudi of Panish Shea and Ravipudi,  Frank Pitre of Cotchett Pitre and McCarthy,  and Mike Kelly of Walkup Melodia Kelly and Schoenberger,  are doing an informational zoom tomorrow with Mike and Riccardo that focuses on dealing with your own insurer and also deals with rights and liabilities as far as third parties are concerned.

We have great people in this world like first responders, firefighters and animal rescuers. All of them out there saving innocent animals in California as I write. This first slide is a 5-day-old puppy found alone under a collapsed building during a fire evacuation in Pasadena during the Eaton Fire. The puppy sustained burned ears and was put in a incubator. This lucky little baby already has foster care.‚ù§Ô∏è
See full story on their page. 

The Pasadena Humane quickly mobilized their resources and boots on the ground went into action. They saved hundreds of pets and wildlife in the Eaton Fire area. They have an incredible record as a compassionate facility and highly recommended for donations. I used to live right next-door to Pasadena in Glendale where I went to college.Great city.

All of these images are Eaton Fire animal victims brought to Pasadena Humane. I apologize for any sensitivities to the slides after 11 with severely burned cats but this is real time animal emergencies and the fires are not over. Forced myself to see the magnitude of injuries to know what I'm praying for and concentrate on the devastation to visualize love & harmony. Something I signed up for a long time ago.

I feel like we have a responsibility as people of this world to take necessary steps on preventing these disasters on soft targets. These animals can't speak but we can!‚ù§Ô∏è

~CALIFORNIA PEOPLE~
PSA: If you live anywhere near the fires, please be aware that wild animals are fleeing the fires and they may show up in your yards.
The California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection is urging you to bring your domestic animals in at night and let the wild animals pass through.
Please put out buckets of water for them.
They are scared, exhausted, and have also lost their homes. They need to refuel. 

May the Creator bless all animals, animal rescuers, vets, first responders, firefighters and all the good samaritans in California.üôè

Balzac

Hugs from behind
Arms 
Wrapped around 
As you sit at your desk shades 
Resting on their 
Sills 
I‚Äôd kill to inhale you 
Hold you 
In 
Until I‚Äôm weak 
Dabbing cheek to cheek 
Keeping tears
Tamed
With eyelashes
Flashes of long quiet
And then it‚Äôs 
‚ÄúOk? Are you ok?‚Äù
Sound more like a squeaky
Slurp slips out 
A mouth of cool coconut oil 
Lips 
A cornet of a city‚Äôs 
Break hearts 
Shuddering under another 
Unwelcome tone defense
Deafening 
Devices 
Collected from our haunted habitats
Play
Littering this LA one room
With its og 1920s molding 
And rags 
Holding wall holes 
(Not)
All together 
And whether 
Our towel protectors 
Provide safety at all 
Is all probably placebo
Anyway 
I guess 
The flesh and the bones 
And the virus and the plastic 
And Asbestos and cheap clothes 
Particles 
Provide acid for our lungs 
Razor blades for tongues 
Noses caked with dry blood
This fire feels like the flood 
And the trope is 
Noah‚Äôs in LA,
But he‚Äôs behind the velvet rope
If your whole world burns down
Before 
You know if they can build it back 
‚ÄúBehind great fortune is great crime.‚Äù
Today
The States all scream 
Balzac 
‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù
I whisper head on shoulder 
Speaking into your hair knots
Because I know that you‚Äôre 
Not 
Ash falls from the sky like
Dust
CNN will soon stop it‚Äôs coverage 
Will you still remember us?
Not all of us are criminals 
Or fashion whores 
For fame 
Most of us are just down bad
And want to bring our children
Home
Again

After arriving at our work location my crew located a residents pond that still had live koi fish. We provided bread from our sac lunches as they likely hadn‚Äôt eaten in over a week. We also came across an injured hawk with severe burns to its tail and talon as well as inhalation injuries. A call was placed to division and an animal control expert arrived to take the injured bird for treatment. My engineer was able to grab the injured bird and hand it over to the experts. In the midst of saving the hawk we located an aviary with finches and their eggs. We provided fresh food and water and animal control will come back to take care of them. #eatonfire @losbanosfire,2025-01-17 06:41:21+00:00

During this time, many folx are just trying to get their feet on the ground, focusing on where they will sleep, how they will shower, having enough socks, and of course, where are they going to live. 

In a few days, weeks, or months, things may resolve themselves. Or‚Äî- they may not. It‚Äôs okay to not feel okay. You don‚Äôt have to face this alone.

Mental health professionals as well as many other people in your communities can provide tools and strategies to help you heal, rebuild, eat, get dressed, pray, move your body and much more. 

üí°Community support groups, hotlines, I.e @211lacounty @mutualaidlosangeles @mutualaidla can guide you to the right resources.

You‚Äôre worthy of care and compassion. Reach out if you need to. We want to hear from you.

Some of these children also lost their homes. Some children are struggling with the idea of losing their school and worry for their friends. All lost a way of life.

This week we talked about the upset of losing their pencil cases with a special pencils that burned in the fire . We talked about their treasures and memories, how it will be different . 

I listened as they talked about how they feel a little guilty about their  friend‚Äôs homes burning down but theirs is okay. 

What  I am hearing  from the children is deep empathy, they are trying to hold it in because they don‚Äôt want to  add any more worry to their parents, a sadness over loss of all the memories attached to the small things that were burned, and worry how things are going to be in the future. 

We have been doing lots of art this week. On their own, they drew their pencil boxes on fire, drawings of their school a blaze  and their frustration and fears with hearing the news.

But yesterday, we decided to look ahead. I gave them the task of drawing the possibilities of what the rebuild of their school could be. So, with great detail, they started to design their new version of their old school. They made sure to keep the parts of their school that didn‚Äôt get hurt in the fire, like the library, and then they added a lazy river, a treehouse in the middle of a horse riding ring and a garden.

This little boy added a news area so the teachers could always know what was happening, and there will always be a police officer stationed out front to protect the school so this can never happen again. 

More than anything this week, I am just listening and letting them know whatever feelings they are experiencing- it‚Äôs okay to have them. 

But we are shifting. I am encouraging them to not give up and to look at the possibilities of rebuilding the future. Because, in my classroom the rule on my wall is #wenevergiveup

To my beloved families in Altadena . I hope you stay. I hope you rebuild. It is communities like Altadena that make the fabric of Los Angeles. I wish everyone hopeful possibilities. As Octavia Butler says, ‚Äú so be it, see to it.‚Äù",2025-01-17 14:29:50+00:00

The Los Angeles fires have deeply affected our community across the entire LA region, and I‚Äôm heartbroken by the loss many have suffered. As we continue to heal, we want to come together to support one of our own, James Lemos, and his family.

James and his wife, Lisa, tragically lost their family home in the Eaton fire, along with James‚Äô treasured plant collection. A longtime member of the San Gabriel, Long Beach, and Los Angeles Cactus and Succulent Societies, James also served as the former president of the Long Beach Cactus Club. The home they lost had been in their family since 1976, holding almost 50 years of memories, and it was a multi-generational home that meant so much to them.

To help James and Lisa recover from this devastating loss, we are hosting this fundraiser auction. All proceeds will go directly to support their recovery as they begin to rebuild their lives from this total loss. 

Please join us in showing our community spirit and offering support to a family who has given so much to our local Succulent Societies.

100% of the auction will go to The Lemos Family and I will also cover shipping anywhere in the USA.  Please bid in increments of $10 and please tag the highest bidder when you bid.  Biding starts at $0 when posted and will end Sunday January 19th 8pm.  If a bid comes in in the last 5 minutes the bidding will be extended by 5 minutes to ensure the person out bid has an opportunity to counter.  Please bid high and please bid often - let‚Äôs support our fellow community member.

As a friend said: Insanity continues. Last night the world‚Äôs largest Lithium-Ion battery storage farm was (is)on fire, uncontrolled and uncontrollable, in Moss Landing. üì∑ Cred KSBW8

A Lithium-Ion battery fire releases hydrogen fluoride gas, which is a very toxic corrosive used to etch glass. A fire like this cannot be put out with water. Water makes it worse.This facility is also next to a Tesla battery farm.

Moss Landing is Central Coast, CA, by Monterey and Santa Cruz for reference. Not by us, but still awful. 

For us, the #palisadesfire it's 31% contained- huge progress overnight, and has not grown. #eatonfire is 65% contained. 8 of the evacuated zones on the NE side of the Palisades fire were able to go home last night ‚ù§Ô∏è

Rivers of melted aluminum left behind from the rims and hubcaps of cars. 

Sump pumps & hoses left in pools, the nozzle still rolled into the hose, where they planned to fight the fire but realized it was coming too quickly. 

A ‚Äútake one leave one‚Äù neighborhood library stand in front of a burnt down house. 

Unexploded ammo and melted guns. 

What blows my mind is what survived‚Ä¶ Statues and ceramic art, cars that were somehow skipped. One house burnt to the ground while it only got part of the backyard and the garage of another. 

Fire is crazy. Firefighters have learned how to read it but it‚Äôs still so unpredictable. 

If a fire is ever coming your way, JUST GET OUT. Your basement/root cellar will collapse in on you, no room is safe, your bathtub and pool full of water WILL NOT save you. Grab the irreplaceable items (photos, etc) and important documents, a couple of changes of clothes for you and your family, your pet & food/shelter for them, and get out. 

On a side note, we were fed very well‚Ä¶ so thank you to everyone sending food, thank you for whoever packed that massive 24 hour pack of food, and thank you to the inmates who made an incredible breakfast and dinner.

This is one of the last if not the very last surviving wood A-Frame house in Altadena that looks exactly how it did when it was built in 1924 by famous author, Kyle Onstott. Kyle was also a competition dog trainer. Prior to the construction of these houses the lot was used as his dog kennel. Outside of the four house houses subdivided on his lot, nearly every other house in the area was destroyed. This house is significant because it sits dead center in the historically Black area of Altadena and represents what many of the houses looked like at its peak.

On the morning of January 8, 2025 my family and I lost our home to the Eaton Fire.  Thankfully we are safe however, the loss has left us in a very difficult situation. As we work to rebuild our lives, we are in need of your support. 

We kindly ask to share our story and raise awareness. Any resources or guidance would help us tremendously. My coworkers surprised me by starting a gofundme to help cover immediate expenses of temporary housing, essential items, and long-term cost of rebuilding our lives.

This m≈´rti caught me by surprise as we wrapped up our first day documenting areas affected by the Eaton Fire. We had just seen a coyote searching for food, put out water for her, and climbed the hill to take in the view from above. Wandering around a corner, I came across a completely destroyed house. At the entrance, it was clear that there had been an altar, with Gane≈õa presiding over the threshold.

I don‚Äôt know if the residents of this home have returned to see what remains of their lives here, and I wonder what will happen to this statue when the bulldozers come to clear the debris. This scene was hard to leave, especially as the full Wolf Moon rose over the hills, owls hooted in the distance, and sounds of chainsaws and helicopters filled the air. I felt like I was abandoning Gane≈õa in this burned landscape.

From what I‚Äôve seen through the lenses of other photographers, many gods, goddesses, and Buddhas held their own as flames tore through everything they were meant to protect. Yet, perhaps what they were truly meant to protect is more subtle: courage, kindness, and hope‚Äîall of which remain abundantly visible in the individuals and communities across Los Angeles.

The owner, also an architect credits saving his home by using fireproof and fire resistant materials. He also landscaped around his property using block walls, fire safe vegetation and reducing the amount of shrub that can grow around the house.

I think it‚Äôs a great topic on how to use these ideas and implementing them onto your own property.
The materials he used can be on the pricier side, however there are other options that can be used in lieu of the ones he describes that can also help mitigate any potential fire damage.

I was born and raised in L.A., a place of complexity, creativity, chaos, history and culture. I love L.A.  with a great passion, and know that it will take a long time for things to heal, I want to do something, and from a distance‚Ä¶ this is me trying. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

I was really impressed by the Officers that responded on mutual aid the first night of the fires.

Aside from the pizzas, we had 1000 sandwiches that were also provided by another party where we were able to leave some boxes with the Guards and continued making several more drops to different locations, including the final stop where I got to meet these amazing guys that are all on duty!! 

One thing I‚Äôve been very grateful for so far this past week, is all the amazing people I‚Äôve got to meet & all the new friends I‚Äôve made with those who are serving. Along with all of those that have joined to volunteer & help out wherever they can

This was author Zane Grey's estate in Altadena, built in 1922. It was acclaimed as the first fireproof home in Altadena and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

When we cleaned this a few years ago before it went on the market, it was fascinating listening to stories from his descendants who grew up on that large property.

The fire has hit the community hard. Three homes that were scheduled to be cleaned the week of the fire burned down, and a handful of homes we've cleaned in the past month burned also. Thankfully the homeowners are safe.

Huge shout to @megisaweirdo for putting this together! 
If you‚Äôve been volunteering on the ground during the LA fires, then you might‚Äôve noticed that donations centers are totally overwhelmed, especially with clothes, and turning people away. PCC is has several dumpsters full of garbage donations. Santa Anita race track is filled to the brim, but doesn‚Äôt have enough volunteers to organize all of it. The outpouring of love is amazing to see, but the sheer amount of physical donations are causing delays.

Three days later, the wildfires that have engulfed Los Angeles began. 

As an investigative newsroom, ProPublica doesn‚Äôt usually cover breaking news, but SB knew she had to document what was going on and knew there were many stories of impact to tell.

Her first stop was Altadena, the historic town just northeast of LA that wasn‚Äôt subject to redlining back in the 1960s. Black families in Altadena have passed those homes down for generations. And today, the Black homeownership rate in the community exceeds 80%, nearly double the national rate.

This is what she saw.

SB and ProPublica will continue covering the aftermath of the fires.

If you live in Altadena and have information that can help inform our reporting, please reach out to us at propublica.org/tips.

It has been so devastating to see these fires destroy so much. 
Although we don‚Äôt live in the Palisades now, we spent 12 beautiful years there. It‚Äôs such a special place, and to see both homes we lived in now gone, breaks my heart.
Our kid‚Äôs schools, our dog‚Äôs vets, our attorney‚Äôs house, friends homes and so many amazing businesses all gone. 
We‚Äôve met so many displaced people on our dog walks here in Marina, and where so many are staying now. Everyone has such different stories to tell.
Last week we donated clothes and essentials at Moss Venice and Venice Family Clinic in Santa Monica. This week we‚Äôll be donating more.
I‚Äôve been sharing resources on how to help on my stories, and created a highlight under LA Fires.
It‚Äôs been so amazing and uplifting to see so many people get together to help, donate and volunteer. 
As a transplant Angelino, moving to LA 18 years ago from Miami was the best decision. I Love LA!

üê¶
1. Dad's surgery went well and he is with my mom at my sister and brother and laws house recovering and starting on all the post fire paper work (Pic 2)
üê¶
2. The house survived thanks to our neighbor Marcus  who stayed and never left. He also saved his house and the next 5 down the block by stopping the fire at our place. The concrete tiles on our roof kept any random embers from igniting also. (Pic 3 our house is center) I kept the picture tight because you do not want to see the zoom out veiw. Our 7 houses are an island of luck in a sea of destruction.
üê¶
3. Needless to say this will heavily effect my running and training volume. I started running again on Tuesday as the air quality is ok now but it feels like I'm running with a 20 pound sack of sorrow so I'm just doing what I can. Like most of us affected I am very emotionally worn out.
üê¶
If any of you want to donate to some of the folks affected but are to far away or don't want to donate to one of the big organizations, DM me and I will send you the gofund link of one of the scores of people I know that have lost their home.

A real LOOK. But a few days after that, we remembered that we did look. When we left, we weren‚Äôt thinking that we would not have a house to return to. We thought it would be still here, maybe damaged somewhat. We gazed quickly as we evacuated. We looked at the house and decided to leave our LED Christmas lights on so we can see if electricity was on. That was our last time to see the house, and that last look gave us comfort for we got to appreciate our home, in that fleeting moment, together.

Out of desperation and a need for social bonding, volunteers have banded together to help Altadena residents.

Four lowriders, parked alongside gas pumps, gleamed in the afternoon sun. Carne asada sizzled on a grill at a pop-up taco stand in the corner. A group of old friends sat on camping chairs and passed around a freshly rolled blunt, cracking jokes and showing each other photos on their phones. Hip-hop played on a wireless speaker.‚Ä®‚Ä®Just feet from the taco stand were a dozen tables piled with donated shirts, blankets and toiletries that were meticulously organized. A moving van loaded with cases of water, boxes of chips and crates of diapers backed into the gas station.‚Ä®‚Ä®The filling station, perched across the street from one of the most destructive wildfires in California‚Äôs history, had suddenly become the vibrant hub of a traumatized neighborhood, a harbor for residents desperate for food, clothes and, especially, community.‚Ä®

The old house was the first place fully my own. The longest stretch I‚Äôve stayed in one place. I remember vividly, twenty plus years ago, my ball-busting former LATimes journalist turned real estate agent called during my lunch break. ‚ÄúCome see this house NOW.‚Äù As soon as I got out of the car and stepped onto that sidewalk, I felt it. This Was The One. I‚Äôve come to realize in my time there- that feeling- it wasn‚Äôt just the house. It was also Altadena. 

My Altadena friends are lifelong friends- ones who‚Äôve circled around me countless times. I cried for my friends. Thanksgivings together. Birthdays at Farnsworth Park. Deep fryer dinners. Sunset hikes to Echo Mountain. Backyard tiki cocktails. And I cried for Altadena because I got to know Altadena. I can‚Äôt fathom the emotions of friends and neighbors who have lost homes. I only mourn my past. What has been. What will never change. My friends and neighbors grieve their today and their future. What was recently lost, and what‚Äôs still to come.

I don‚Äôt know if the Eaton firestorm extinguished Altadena‚Äôs magic. I do know this resilient community will pull together. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs enough to restore the magic. But you should know the Altadena we knew.

After 10 days I‚Äôm still trying to fathom what LA has experienced in the form of total destruction, devastation and heartbreak for both our city and all its Angelino residents ‚Ä¶ no adequate words!

So I thought that a little levity is needed after witnessing the remarkably sad and incredible photos and videos shared by everyone ‚Ä¶

Thus ‚ÄúLA Story‚Äù is a quick reminder of how wonderful, charismatic and whimsical the greatest city on the planet is all about ‚Ä¶ Steve Martin‚Äôs screenplay for 1991‚Äôs fanciful satire, L.A. Story, in which Martin plays the lovelorn weatherman trying to navigate the idiosyncrasies of Los Angeles. 

Martin‚Äôs character has a penchant for roller skating through LACMA while his friend Ariel (Susan Forristal) videotapes the antics for a private, amateur video series called Harris K. Telemacher‚Äôs World of Art.

The director (Jackson) says it was imperative to film at LACMA, but getting permission to roller skate around priceless pieces of art would have been near impossible but for the fact that Martin served on the museum‚Äôs Board of Trustees from 1984 to 2004.
Jackson remembers a meeting with the museum‚Äôs management. ‚ÄúJackson said, *We‚Äôd like to have Steve roller skating down here and just zooming in and out of these sculpture busts. They went, ‚ÄòMmm hmm,‚Äô and you could see the look of terror start to dawn on their faces. And they said, ‚ÄòWill it be the trustee who is doing the skating?‚Äô We said, ‚ÄòYes, yes. Steve.‚Äù The museum acquiesced.

The image of Steve Martin appearing in shoes with retractable roller skate wheels is one that adorns the film‚Äôs teaser poster.

My family joked that I was like Snow White in my little cottage. It really felt like that. I had been lost for so long across the city and suburbs and had finally found my own safe haven that truly felt like home here in magical  #Altadena. I remember the first time I drove up that hill into our neighborhood 7 years ago and I had this deep knowing that I was ‚Äúhome‚Äù. In my life I have experienced deep bouts of depression and often times I would describe it as feeling homesick. This past week I have been thinking about what it means to be ‚Äúhome‚Äù and how to find that feeling again.

Huge thanks to photo editor @allisonrosehess ‚ú® As a former New Yorker and current Angeleno, this story by writer @rosecransbaldwin resonated with me:

‚ÄúOne of the few moments that I‚Äôve laughed in the past two weeks was when I saw a post on social media suggesting that confused New Yorkers, to grasp the conflagration, might imagine Central Park on fire. With around 40,000 acres burned and 12,000 structures destroyed, make it more like 47 Central Parks.‚Äù

This was the first time I covered a natural disaster of this scale and devastation while at home. So many friends lost their homes and we are extremely fortunate that our neighborhood was spared. Sending love and strength to all those impacted by the fires.

My fairy godparents, the Hilfmans, ARE my heart. Their home, my home away from home, was a vast extension of their own hearts. The true love they share for eachother and their community was literally planted by their own hands in the Santa Monica Mountains. They put everything into their sanctuary. Greg took his land in Topanga (where he was living in his van as a young keys player in LA) and painstakingly built his dream estate with his dream girl over the course of many, many years. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, their garden and the chateau had reached peak magnificence. Each tile and ivory key in the recording studio, installed by Greggy himself. When Greg gave Cindy his spare kidney to try to save her precious life for all of us, he suffered a heart attack at home, only to be brought back to life by his wife (and her new kidney). They LOVE each other. They love their family. They love their home. They love their friends, and we can‚Äôt imagine a world without the Hilfmans‚Äô and their home in Topanga. I grew up doing the most legendary Jewish-ish Topanga Christmas at The Hilfmans‚Äô each year. Our ping pong competition and our yearly Tom Petty singalong was an event I always circled 20 times on the calendar. In my teens and twenties, I never hesitated driving up the canyon and laying all of my worries and fears on the doorstep of The Hilfman‚Äôs home. It had always been such a safe place for my spirit. 
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve been watching the news and know what‚Äôs been happening in our beloved city of angels. The Hilfmans evacuated like most of us, but I‚Äôm heartbroken to say that their home did not survive the fires. 
I know so many have lost so much, but if you wouldn‚Äôt mind taking a moment to share or donate to their GoFundMe, my family and I would be so grateful. 

I hope that wherever you are, you are safe and know that you are loved.

The last 11 days have not been easy witnessing the destruction and immense hardships for those impacted by the blazes.

Bethany and her daughter evacuated their house due to the Eaton Fire, and the home filled with smoke and currently has no heat. Bethany‚Äôs grandmother is still in the house. 

I obtained Bethany‚Äôs contact info directly from the filmmaker @gilad_thaler. I then chatted with Bethany on the phone, and while she didn‚Äôt have a GFM yet, she decided to create one after we spoke. I‚Äôm posting a link to the GFM in my bio. 

Please consider donating. They were able to get temporary housing with the help of a nonprofit but their housing runs out in a few days. I do not know the status of Bethany‚Äôs grandmother, but if anyone knows of any orgs or agencies that could help her, please share! THANK YOU.

Those who have not experienced evacuation or loss of a home consider themselves lucky, but we all know at least one relative, friend, colleague, or classmate who have not been lucky.

Donate to Nate & Molly Perkins via the GoFundMe link in my bio. They escaped their home with their 5yr old daughter just hours before their home burned to the ground. 

The devastation is unreal. In many ways, giving money directly is best once a victim is safe. They packed the essentials. What they need is the money for a mortgage they still pay for, for a home that isn‚Äôt there, for groceries, for every single item that we take for granted. A clothespin for an opened chip bag, scissors, a spatula. 

It‚Äôs like a tragic death - except there is no funeral. 

There is no handbook. You are left with nothing but the few things you took with you in the car while embers are flying in the wind. There is nothing else. Refugees in your own city slowly putting the pieces back together.

Name: Tania Rashid
Location: Los Angeles, CA

üìÅ What I do in real life: I‚Äôm a journalist and documentary filmmaker, bringing light to important global and local stories.

ü´∂üèΩ How I got involved with Volunteer Squad: Seeing the devastation caused by the fires, I felt compelled to step in and support those affected. Joining Volunteer Squad has given me a way to channel that into action.

‚õëÔ∏è What I‚Äôve been doing with The Squad: Today, I had the opportunity to help one person who lost their home, providing them with food and clothing. It was a small but powerful reminder of how much a little kindness can mean. I look forward to contributing more in the days to come.

ü´Ç What I want to share: Every act of service counts. Meeting someone face-to-face and being part of their journey toward recovery is deeply humbling. This experience is a powerful reminder of the resilience and strength within our community.

residents don't have the bandwidth to shop, eat out, or go about their usual routine while they're trying to recover from a major loss or while they're working to help those who did.

i stopped by @lalalandkindcafe on montana in #santamonica. all the seats inside the coffeeshop were taken, which seemed like a sign that the regulars continue to stop by for a place to sit and work, chat with friends, or be distracted from the bleak new reality. but the order line was shorter than i've seen it to be. was it the time of day (just before lunch on a weekday) or were people just spending less money? or is it because a good chunk of the business in the area comes from the palisades, and they've evacuated elsewhere?

this shop has a higher than average price point, which is one of the reasons i don't frequent the place. $12 pre-tax for an iced americano and a croissant is something i can't afford to spend on a regular basis. although i do have to say the warmed #pistachio croissant with #pistachiobutter and a dusting of chocolate powder from @farmshopca was a new (for me) treat! 

my dining choices for the day went from that breakfast luxury to an affordable meal provided by @foreverytable at the @smcedu #disasterrelief event. my choice from the variety offered the volunteers was a #salmon #superfood salad, which was a healthier option than my brunch, although not as decadent üòâüòâ

i've included info about the donation drive i've been volunteering at. right now, we're sorting items that have been donated; they will be distributed jan 22-24 at the santa monica main campus at 1900 pico. please bring ID.

Rebuilding will be a lengthy arduous process with many unknowns. Currently local designers and realtors are working towards helping fire victims settle into temporary housing and provide furnished rentals or work to get them essentials like beds and sofas so they have a soft landing as they get back on their feet (see tagged resources below). For my part I‚Äôd like to coordinate small styling packages to folks once they are more settled. These would be curated packages that could include things like rugs, artwork, pillows, lamps, vases, curtains etc and all those finer details that help a space feel like a home and not like a hotel. Many people lost those little trinkets that were their grandma‚Äôs, the vase made by their aunt, and all those small but meaningful items we pass down through generations. My goal is to ease some of that loss by helping make a place that is not their home feel at least a little bit more reflective of who they are and what they lost. These will be small treasures they can take with them when they do rebuild as a reminder of their strength and resilience. I‚Äôve included examples in the next slides.

HOW TO HELP // Are you a brand or know one willing to donate or heavily reduce the cost for styling items and accents pieces for the home? Have you already seen posts you could send me? Do you own a thrift shop items you could pass on? Are you an artist with a printshop? A designer who has some styling items? If so please drop your/ their handle in the comments, send me a DM, or email to connect us. I will gather a list of vendors from which I can pull from to give these styling packages to some folks when they are feeling more secure in their temporary housing in the coming months.

Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @theleftbankla OK, LET‚ÄôS DO THIS

I‚Äôve been hearing the most effective way to get folks in need clothing right now is local free pop up markets they can shop or send a friend to shop. So let‚Äôs make it a party! 

WHAT: A FUN FREE clothing market for our ladies affected by the LA fires.  Music, drinks and sweet treats on us as you shop! 

WHEN: SUNDAY JANUARY 26, 10AM-4PM 
or until we‚Äôre out. 

WHERE:  Left Bank 2479 Fletcher Drive (in our backyard! Enter through the alley!)

SELLERS: we are buying every day this week via drop off! Please come sell! It keeps us in business. :) Anything we do not purchase can be returned to you,  or donated to the FREE market! 

We will be accepting limited outright donations for this. PLEASE LIMIT IT to one medium/large bag of curated CLEAN items in GOOD CONDITION. We are a tiny team. And I want to spend as much time making this cute for our girls and less time figuring out what to do with damaged clothing. Keep in mind people do not have access to laundry right now. 

Spread the word!

1. I've been walking the fine line between getting things accomplished to transition us to this next phase of our lives and listening to my body and my emotions for when I need to grieve, be angry, be grateful, and be present for my wife.

2. I'm there for others as I have the energy to do so. This is an extra expenditure and I give myself grace when I need all the energy I have to do what I need to do for my family.

3. I'm taking action and pivoting as needed when I get informed guidance that I need to iterate on what I'm doing.

4. I'm allowing myself grace over all the 'shoulda, woulda, coulda's regarding what I didn't save from the fire.

5. I'm allowing myself grace to not know exactly what comes next. Right now, there are urgent tasks, so I'm focusing on them and my family.

But again, thank you to everyone who had offered support in any fashion.

It means the world to us.

üëãüèº I asked myself that question late last year as I stopped to take this sunset photo of the Hi! Let‚Äôs Eat! sign in #Lompoc (üì∑ 1). The restaurant where it originally stood for more than 55 years was torn down in 2017 to make way for a Starbucks (because OF COURSE), but the sign was saved and restored and in December 2022 reappeared at its new home: the parking lot at American Host Restaurant, a breakfast-and-lunch spot that opened in 1982 and is still going strong. 
üí°@americanhostrestaurant owner Dennis Block happily welcomed the #HiLetsEatSign even though its newly installed LED lights are visible only at night, hours after his own restaurant has closed for the day. Block‚Äôs decision helped save a piece of #Lompoc history. And at the time, I vowed to eat at his restaurant ‚Äì where my late mother and her friend Kathleen were semi-regulars ‚Äî more often as a show of thankful support. But there I was, two years and zero follow-ups later. 

ü•û I‚Äôve since rectified the situation, stopping by American Host last week for a breakfast (üì∑3) of #pancakes, #sausages and #sunnysideup eggs served with the traditional American flag pick on top. üá∫üá∏ I‚Äôll return again soon, either for breakfast or a replay of the Ortega / Swiss burger I ordered when Kathleen and I last met there for lunch in April 2022 (üì∑ 4 & 5).

Then yesterday an 18 wheeler truck showed up in the region at 9 am to deliver several hundred air purifies for the office.  Got them set up yesterday afternoon and the office is ready to go!

KW Cares once again did NOT disappoint when it comes to taking care of our Agents.  Glad to be back with an organization that goes above and beyond for its Staff & Agents.

Our office is open to ANYONE who was affected by the fires.  If you need WiFi, a quiet and safe place to work or print, stop by.  There is plenty of free parking.  We have cold refreshments as well!

Amidst this all, Hadley lived in bliss and had a fun vacation and really embraced the ‚Äúresort‚Äù lifestyle. She enjoyed ice cream, restaurant-prepared dog food, a field trip to Bass Pro Shop (more pics soon), and plenty of time exploring hotels & their grounds. 

We‚Äôre grateful to come home to a clean-ish & safe home but heartbroken for so many of our friends and community. Altadena & Eaton Canyon will always be special to us and will be back better than ever.

I learned the person with the hose didn‚Äôt live there and a neighbor said he had never seen him before.  There was a second person with him that I saw when I walked up to that fire and when I turned around he disappeared.  It is possible they were Good Samaritans, thrill seekers, or possibly looters.

We will have items from Brooks, New Balance, Saucony, HOKA, Mizuno, Topo, Rabbit, and more. 

Details: 
Date: Sunday, January 19
Time: 9am-12pm 

A few things we wanted to call out are the following: 
‚û°Ô∏è One of each per person
‚û°Ô∏è Must show ID to prove residency in Altadena 
‚û°Ô∏è Unfortunately no kids sizes
‚û°Ô∏è While quantities last

Tomorrow was supposed to be the @mccourtfoundation Rose Bowl Pasadena Half Marathon, but they did the right thing in cancelling it for tomorrow, postponing it to a future date. Many of us were planned to run it, but instead we will be giving back to our community through this event.

I invited the family I work with who lost their home and everything in it in the Eaton Fire, and responded, ‚ÄúI lost my wonderful @hoka running shoes,‚Äù and are therefore looking forward to this.

Thank you to #RunWithUs for putting this on and their brand partners I‚Äôm happy to be an ambassador for this wonderful store and team of runners who serves their community.

Wildfire zones can be full of toxic materials, sharp objects, and irritants, which is why decontamination is essential for protecting our K9s‚Äô health. It also gives us a chance to check for injuries and ensure they‚Äôre ready for whatever tomorrow brings. 

These incredible dogs work tirelessly to help bring closure to families and communities. Keeping them safe and healthy is the least we can do in return.

Our neighborhood, close to the start of the fire, was untouched, but it‚Äôs still eerily empty. Here are a few photos from the periphery of the burn zone, which covers 2/3 of Altadena. Its intense. On one side of the street, armed troops keeping people out. On the other side, mutual aid groups, kids cooking up free hotdogs, and all the things that make this such a beautiful, vibrant community. The word community cannot be overemphasized. I hope it can withstand greedy speculators preying on people who have lost everything. What is happening right now in Altadena is how this country will withstand the next few years.

This architectural gem, renowned for its unique design and rich history, has miraculously survived the flames that claimed many neighboring structures.

Built in 1922, the Balian Mansion reflects a masterful blend of Mediterranean Revival and Beaux-Arts styles. Its grand arched windows, intricate detailing, and stately columns evoke the opulence of early 20th-century design, while the tiled roof and stucco exterior showcase Mediterranean influences. The expansive grounds and elegant landscaping have made it a centerpiece of Altadena‚Äôs architectural heritage.

This mansion has not only stood the test of time but has also been a beloved community landmark, especially known for its extravagant holiday light displays that have drawn visitors from all over Southern California.

The survival of this historic home preserves a vital piece of Altadena‚Äôs cultural and architectural legacy. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of protecting our landmarks and the resilience of our communities. If you have stories or memories of the Balian Mansion, please share them as we celebrate its endurance.

Over the course of two days, all search teams involved cleared more than 600 houses.

With kids scattered all over the LA County, a few even even in San Diego & NorCal. We were able to still get 12 kids all displaced 4 of which lost everything to come out today on one day notice. Some came from as far as West LA & Harbor City just to get on field and be around their comrades again. It was a really great time to get them back into the flow and bring some normalcy back into their lives. Max C. shared a story during practice that very 1st thing he grab we told to evacuate was his bat, not some video game system. That is definitely a sign of a real ball player. I was also able to return home and meet the firefighter in charge of public information for the Altadena Eaton fire. He is from up north near Redding, CA. Our neighbor Charlie R. got a chance to take a pic after his victorious AYSO all star soccer game, in which @aysoregion13 Pasadena defeated Arcadia üí™. ABA‚Äôs Owen O.‚Äôs Pasadena AYSO all star soccer team also won their matchup 2-1 today. During that game there was an absolutely awesome moment when the very 1st goal scored was by an Altadena kid who lost his home in fire. Man, you got to love that, it gave me goosebumps when I heard it. Moments like that is the reason why I love sports. It was great to get back on the field today as we had been on a break and had been scheduled to return the Tuesday the fire broke out. We will be back on the diamond this Tuesday at Jackie Robinson Park and I can‚Äôt wait.

Please join us, and our friends from @d.pizza.spot in Leimert Park this Sunday, January 19th, for a special fundraiser to support the displaced families of the Eaton fire. In times of need, it is important to band together as a community to assist others. We are bent, but far from broken. 

We will be set up on 43rd Place and Crenshaw just outside of the park. The families we wish to support are in need of essential hygiene products and women‚Äôs self-care products. Please refrain from bringing clothing items. As there is a much greater need for the items listed above. 

All monetary proceeds from pizza sales will be donated to @sliceouthunger to continue feeding families in need. Thank you in advance for your attendance. We look forward to serving you! üôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏èüçï

For everyone who read my last two posts, you know I‚Äôm donating many of my services (100% discounted) to anyone who FOSTERS or ADOPTS a pooch from any of the LA shelters or rescue organizations taking in displaced pooches from the recent fires. A huge THANK YOU to @montecitojournal for spreading the word within our wonderful and caring community.

Almost all of the animal shelters and rescue organizations in LA desperately need the community‚Äôs help to relieve the dire overcrowding at their facilities from the hundreds of displaced animals (not just dogs) taken in since the fires began. Many shelters can‚Äôt accept any additional animals, including dogs, because they simply don‚Äôt have anymore space. By fostering or adopting one dog, you are not only saving this dog but you are helping to create the space to save another dog.

Perhaps the only thing greater than creating a life is saving one, which is why I‚Äôm donating my services, including my 2-hour ‚ÄúConnecting Parents & their Pooches‚Äù first-time bonding session, at a 100% discount to anyone who saves a life during this time ü©µ

The wildfires have severely impacted LA, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking to witness such extensive loss. I‚Äôve been observing the sky and listening to helicopters buzzing overhead. During these moments of devastation, it‚Äôs challenging to express the right sentiments. ‚Å£
‚Å£
However, despite the difficult path ahead, the community is uniting -offering help, support, and standing by each other. This serves as a reminder that even in our toughest times, we are never alone. Even in the darkest hours, the city will rise again, rebuilding and shining brighter than ever. ‚ú®ü´∂üèº‚Å£

Just 3 miles north of us is my former hood in Altadena. An elderly man told me, ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll just have to start over.‚Äù I smell the devastated land of the home where I used to live and paint in which burned down last week. Altadena was my old hood, living there from 2006-2009, & Pasadena from 2009-2010 & back to Altadena in 2019. 
  I used to love to go to the Mountain View cemetery; to the Coffee Gallery & The Rancho. We filmed my 1st music video at the bottom of Angeles Forest for the song ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say that‚Äù. Altadena has always had a special place in my heart. It is where my Art & music bloomed and flourished. It is where I made my 1st Self Portrait in a painting. I‚Äôd only made pen and ink and pencil self-portraits in the past: These 1st 2 were paintings based on photos. Taken inside my bedroom studio by my friends and I, which turned into a few paintings. These are the good old days.

Very early in the morning of January 7th I woke up to the smell of smoke and the sound of howling wind.  I looked out the living room window to see that the normally-vast view was completely obscured by smoke.  I threw on clothes, ran outside into the sunrise, and saw that everything was covered with ash.  I‚Äôd pick up a large piece and think, ‚ÄúWas this from someone‚Äôs house?‚Äù ü§ç  It turned out I was living between two fast-moving fires and the ash was probably blowing from Altadena.  The fire was getting closer to jumping a freeway and if it did, my hill could be in its path. ü§ç  It‚Äôs an interesting experience to quickly inventory exactly what you‚Äôre going to take with you if you have to leave with the threat of losing everything. (First on my list: my cats and my journals.) ü§ç  This first exhausting day was spent constantly checking the news while also heeding some kind of animal instinct for survival, should it come to that. ü§ç  As news of the L.A. fires spread around the world, I received concerned messages from my ‚Äúspace friends,‚Äù which were extremely heartening to me. ü§ç  These photos were taken a few days into the drama when I absolutely had to go outside for something.  I thought the smoke was creating an interesting effect, so for only the thousandth time in my life I took a risk for art ( or ‚Äúart,‚Äù as the case may be), since the air was considered unhealthy to breathe. ü§ç  For now the fires are gradually coming under control, though the devastation is hard to fathom.  The human spirit is unbelievably tough, but, as they now say, this is ‚Äúa lot.‚Äù My heart goes out to those who lost loved ones, homes, businesses ‚Ä¶  The postmortems will be endless. ü§ç  Weather experts are saying the fire danger returns this week.  I have my cat carriers, my journals, a ton of alerts on my phone, but these events seem to send one down an existential path. ü§ç  Smoke gets in your eyes.

üì£ Here are a few resources you may find helpful.

Navigating the aftermath of the L.A. and Altadena/Eaton area fires can feel overwhelming, but the right resources make all the difference. 

Tune in today at 1 PM PT @kbla1580 - I speak with Attorney Amber Finch, a top global insurance recovery attorney with the law firm Reed Smith LLP, on The Legal Lens Show about the most common challenges wildfire victims face when dealing with insurance claims.

This discussion covers essential tips for documenting damages, avoiding common pitfalls during the claims process, and understanding your insurance policy and rights. 

If you miss the show, the episode will be available next week on the Legal Lens Podcast for on-demand listening - make sure to follow me to know when it‚Äôs available üéôÔ∏è

Reed Smith LLP has also compiled expert advice into a great article, to help simplify the claims process. 

Additionally, the California Department of Insurance is hosting workshops and offering wildfire-specific resources to guide residents through this challenging time.

I realized after we had arrived at the @astraluminaexperience, that this is the only Christmas gift to survive the fire.

As we journeyed from one experience to another, breathing in our escape from the rigors of our daily ritual of recovery from our loss, it also became clear that this excursion into the landscape of the night sky was part of our healing process.

It was a declaration that we are more than our belongings and that part of the rebuilding of our lives will be an understanding that these next chapters we live out will serve us best if we interject intermissions of experience that connect us meaningfully to who we were before the fire took so much of us.

My wife and I have always had an affinity for the stars, visiting observatories and marveling at the misty haze of the Milky Way from a lava field.

We're also avid visitors to botanical gardens, drinking in diverse naturescapes along manmade paths.

Astra Lumina gave us back a sense of ourselves and served as an unexpected salve for two souls who needed a bit of stardust to remind us that all is not lost and that the lights in the sky still hold power if we only dare to hold our heads high enough to keep them in our sights. ‚ú®Ô∏è",2025-01-19 16:48:39+00:00

Today, our team, along with all eight search teams from across the county, is finally getting some much-needed rest after many intense days of search and recovery efforts at the Eaton and Palisades Fires. During these operations, we had the honor of working alongside incredible Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams from across the state. Together, we searched burned properties, supporting families and communities impacted by these devastating fires. 
 
This model of collaboration between the fire service and volunteer SAR teams is rare, typically reserved for large-scale incidents like these. The teamwork, dedication, and professionalism displayed by everyone involved were truly exceptional and played a vital role in recovery efforts.
 
We extend our deepest gratitude to the USAR teams for their hard work, hospitality, and camaraderie throughout this mission. Though we never hope to face such tragedies again, we stand ready to serve our communities whenever called upon. 
 
Stay safe, everyone, and thank you for your continued support. Together, we make a difference. üí™ #Teamwork #SearchAndRescue #MontroseSAR #community #EatonFire #PalisadesFire #LASD",2025-01-19 18:20:38+00:00

Windblown ash particles may be too large to be detected by air quality instrumentation and not reflected in the Air Quality Index (AQI) map. However, they are typically visible to the naked eye either in the air or on outdoor surfaces. Although the AQI may show green, hazardous ash may be present in the air.

This is a tribute to one of my favorite, easy nature escapes from the city.

I‚Äôve spent countless hours there.
I‚Äôve taught kids there (pic 3).
I did my naturalist training there (pic 4).
I‚Äôve gone there with friends and family (pic 7). 
I was last there September to escape a heatwave with my dog Zuzu (pic 9). 

Particularly in my @uccalnat certification study through @pcclancer, I tracked the plants in a specific area of the canyon for weeks on end. To this day I say hi and give hugs to the coast live oaks and laurel sumacs that were part of the foundational study of what I do today. 

The fire map looks like the whole campground area and half way up into the canyon was burned. Maybe not the waterfall itself? Maybe my plant friends were spared? Time will tell. 

But this is a tribute to a place I love, that has suffered an injury that saddens me, but a place I know will regrow anew that gives me hope.

There‚Äôs also solid potential for ‚Äúmountain waves‚Äù leading to localized gusts that are even stronger, a phenomena we saw during the firestorm the first night of the Eaton Fire. Relative humidity will drop to the single digits, and fuels are at or near record dry levels in many areas under the Red Flag Warning, even drier than the beginning of the previous fire siege. The dangerous combination of extremely dry fuels, bone dry humidity, strong winds, existing fires, all create conditions for ‚ÄúFOR VERY RAPID FIRE SPREAD AND EXTREME FIRE BEHAVIOR.‚Äù (Quotes from the @nwslosangeles forecast). 

We are not out of the woods yet, and hopefully we don‚Äôt have any new ignitions that get established or any control issues on existing fires. Crews have been using infrared aerial mapping to tackle any latent pieces of heat within 300 feet of current firelnes, and hopefully that will mitigate risk. 

At the very least we are going to have blowing ash from these fires and AQI issues.

But I was asked to give a quote about my experience for a newsletter and it really forced me to sit down with my thoughts. Here‚Äôs what I shared -

‚ÄúNothing prepares you for covering a catastrophe like the Eaton Fire. The second our KCRA crew got into the evacuation zone, my eyes started burning - I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was from the lingering smoke or from holding back tears. All we could see was devastation in every direction. As a born and raised Californian, my heart breaks for the people who lost everything. For many LA families, decades of memories were gone in an instant, but their hope and resilience is awe-inspiring. Piece by piece, Los Angeles will come back stronger than ever with help from ALL Californians.‚Äù

It‚Äôs turned open to a page that feels most comforting to me. Out of anything I have ever written, I go back to this again and again because it speaks to the impermanence of circumstances and the duality of the nature of life. Light and dark, ebbs and flows, tragedies and triumphs. Life is mysterious but we know for certain that no one thing lasts forever. Not the good experiences and not the bad experiences. Life would not exist without both. Life would not be life. We just experienced a historical disaster in California (a tragedy I wish with all of my heart did not happen) AND the we in the LA and greater LA community are already rallying together to help rebuild. We, as a nation, are about to experience a major change tomorrow AND we will experience another one in 2028. Take it from me, 2025 has already been a long four years in California I can‚Äôt imagine more chaos, but we must continue trusting in the nature of life ‚Äî her demand for balance ‚Äî and never let the bad bury us so when the good comes we are able to see it.

I authentically love getting dressed up fancy and acting crazy. The music was a hilarious cross section of over 50 years of hit songs, and everyone was having a wonderful time. I remember thinking how blessed I felt to have such a beautiful city and community to be a part of.

These are the sentiments that reverberate in my head after the shock of evacuation. So many beautiful places that have come to be a part of my home and landscape are now gone, and it leaves the spaces where they were filled with echoes. I miss my running route, now mostly filled with burnt homes and debris. I miss my grocery store, and wonder what happened to the people working there, if they have jobs now. I feel so lucky that our home wasn't burnt, but also feel angry that so many weren't so fortunate. It can be horrifying to realize that random chance is the thing keeping so many things you love intact. The only thing to be done is to love and be grateful for the things you have.

If I had known the strife in store for my community and loved ones a week later I would have spent more time talking to my neighbors. I would have taken more walks. I would have tried to sacrifice more of my time to connect and be kind to others, and I wouldn't have been so hard on myself. I hope these words bring some love to you on a Sunday afternoon. To those who I know and those I don't yet know: I am grateful for you, you deserve love and connection.

As a UCLA graduate, much of my crew is in LA, and I felt a deep need to be there in person‚Äîto hug them, support them, and remind them they are loved and they are not alone. While there, I brought my 35mm camera and walked the streets of Altadena, Pacific Palisades, and Malibu, for four days straight, photographing the destruction these fires had on homes, communities and lives. Block after block, my heart fucking broke more and more, but as I spent 15 years of my life making documentary films, it has been foundational to me as a human to bear witness to the world. At times I questioned why I was even taking photos, but I felt compelled to document what I saw through my lens and share it for all to see. Capturing these images felt like a way to preserve the history of this moment, to honor those we lost, and to hold space in my heart for everyone whose lives have been irrevocably changed by the fires. Los Angeles, we love you.

From what I observed, every opportunity to help an animal in need was taken seriously. During our ride-along, their mission was to check  on two cats left alone, and to assist an elderly man and his canine companions who couldn‚Äôt leave their Altadena home. 

Yet, even for this seemingly routine operation, the team conducted a thorough briefing, gathered supplies, and approached every moment with skilled logistics and hearts full of compassion. Each member of the team struck a remarkable balance between professionalism and kindness.

K9 Global Rescue‚Äôs pop-up basecamp housed chickens, turkeys, turtles, lizards, and dogs. Even as you read this, they continue working tirelessly to find foster or permanent homes for all the animals in their care. 

Working alongside them restored my hope that we, as humans, can navigate the challenges ahead - responding to increasingly frequent weather and fire events while striving to dismantle the systems of oppression that harm animals and keep people unaware of their suffering.

Like other teams we accompanied while on assignment for @sanctuary_doc in LA - these people are angels on earth.

 RP: @blackownedfoodla x @ebonymagazine üíôü¶ã 

""For generations, Altadena has been a sanctuary for Black families, a place where culture and community thrive. During the Great Migration, when millions of Black Americans sought better opportunities and safety, my own family made the journey from Albany, Georgia, to Pasadena and Altadena, planting roots and contributing to the vibrant legacy of this area. Now, as fires have devastated our community, displacing families and reshaping lives, it‚Äôs more crucial than ever to come together and provide the support needed to preserve and rebuild this cherished haven."" - Chasity Londyn

I wanted to original start ""Sole Food Gamer"" shorts with sonething fun, but unfortunately with the beginning of the new year with Los Angeles burning. I felt it a little crass to talk about relating to food, games, sneakers, or fun in general ( don't get it twisted, those articles are primed and ready to go.) Still I wanted to talk a bit about some of the consequences of the fires. Even though smoke is in the immediate milage around Pasadena, Altenda, Palisades, and Eaton. There is still lots of fallout, chemicals, ash still in the air. Being a Long Beach native I am about 40 miles away, but I still am affected especially since I suffer from allergenic rhinitis. As mentioned online and in the news; if you have to be outside for any considerable amount of time. Make sure you have a N95 or P100 mask. There was a small shortage the first week, but they are in stock again at Home Depot and on Amazon. The mask help a lot. As an example; once I am exposed for more than an hour outside. I get nasal congestion and a cough. Also when driving use the recycled air button in your AC so you don't breathe in the toxins. While the main Palisades fire has reached the 50% mark and Eaton is 80% mark. We aren't out of the woods yet for air safety. So stay prepared and be safe out there! #fire #palisadesfire #firesafety #eatonfire #badair #poorairquality #N95 #P100 #filteringmasks",2025-01-20 02:39:37+00:00

The devastation wreaked by the Eaton and Palisades fires in my hometown has me shaken and grief-stricken to the core. I struggle to find words of inspiration, although I am grateful to be alive and for the first responders who are fighting these fires. But for my community, my heart is broken. 

The house above is not ours. Although we evacuated, the fire did not reach our neighborhood‚Ä¶this time. 

The same cannot be said for many close friends in Altadena, Pasadena, the Palisades, and Malibu; for their friends and neighbors‚Äîentire communities that have been destroyed and will never be the same. 

This house belonged to our dear friends Marcus and Shawna Beer in Altadena. They evacuated around 4am in the dark on Jan 8 and lost everything, along with all their neighbors. Everything has been reduced to chimneys and ash. 

It is impossible to replace all that has been lost, and the road to recovery is going to be long and hard.

If you can, please consider a donation to help those who lost everything such as via GoFundMe (you can find the Beers GFM in Bio @saucela ) or to a vetted organization providing wildfire relief. Every little bit will help.

We were spared but I have no words and my heart is broken üòû

It was nice to pull up at the shop on a cold LA night to find lots of people out supporting our local restaurants. Please keep it up! It might seem like the right thing to some NOT to shop or eat out--I've heard comments like wanting to give us space and time to process--but what we small businesses need is you! 

We need to work, and we need to re-order product from our small brands, and we need to support the many local brands, factories and services connected to what we all do.  Because behind every store, brand, factory, etc. are humans trying to provide for themselves and their families. And we're all so connected. 

Thanks so much to everyone who's supported our small business communities since the fires began. If you're at all able, please support small independent businesses in NELA no matter where you are. If you need recs, we've got them. 

Finally, to everyone out there who has supported victims, firefighters, evacuees, and pets, there aren't sufficient words ü´∂üèºü´∂üèºü´∂üèº. Hoping this community-minded support we're seeing from all over the world becomes a model for how we care for each other in times of crisis.

With the opening of my Etsy Shop, I want to donate half of all proceeds to @pasadenahumane for relief of the SoCal Eaton Wildfires ü´∂üèªüê∂üê± Our friends need our help, and this is how I hope to bring some smiles, hope, and monetary relief to the effort. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

My muse really are our furry little friends, and the joy they bring into our lives is priceless. Many pets and animals were hurt, lost, and traumatized by the recent fires. I hope to help with a little painting or gift of your sweet pet, and we can help someone else‚Äôs loved one as well 

Thank you all so much for following me on this next chapter! Let‚Äôs create some beautiful art, and a beautiful world.",2025-01-20 04:07:18+00:00

It‚Äôs been very inspiring to see someone use their platform for so much good, and an honor to be a small part of the operation.

Burned oranges hanging from burned trees. Streets lined with tables put up by volunteers offering food, water, clothing to their neighbors. Hillsides stained with pink fire retardant. The incessant screaming of chainsaws and jackhammers. A woman came and stood next to me taking pictures. She asked if I had lost my home. I said no, and she said she hadn't lost hers, either. She said the fire had stopped a few feet from her house. She had just gone to Costco and bought as much water as she could fit in her car and then dropped it off with the volunteers across the street. We gave each other a hug and she left.

City of Angels

I feel like a cat with nine lives, and I just used up two of them within four months of each other.

During my current seasonal stay in Los Angeles, an Evacuation Warning alert sounded on my phone. A raging blaze in a nearby community, known as the Eaton Fire, rapidly grew in strength due to an unprecedented weather event that generated hurricane-force winds. A similar scenario played out last September in Lake Arrowhead (see my 9.21.24 post).

Thankfully the flames never reached my LA neighborhood, but thousands of other folks weren‚Äôt as fortunate. In the blink of an eye, the Eaton Fire decimated half of Altadena and parts of Pasadena. On the other side of the city, the Palisades Fire incinerated nearly 75% of Pacific Palisades and stretches of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.

More than 25 people lost their lives, and many others remain missing.

Huge heartfelt thanks to the angelic souls, especially @losangelesfiredepartment , who showed up without hesitation to assist those in need. Here‚Äôs how you can help the helpers:

@baby2baby seeks donations for diapers, formula, baby food and blankets.
@habitatla needs volunteers and donations to assist with rebuilding homes.
@laanimalservices has issued an urgent plea for fosters and adopters to take pets from its crowded shelters.
@mercychefs seeks donations to feed free meals to people displaced by the LA wildfires and those still affected by Hurricane Helene in Asheville, NC.
@pasadenahumane requests help fostering pets displaced by the fires.
@projectangelfood needs donations and volunteers to fill delivery routes and kitchen shifts.
@wckitchen accepts support through donations and volunteers to feed free meals to impacted neighborhoods.

The dawn of a new day brings hope and promise to the devastated areas of our beloved city. Let there be no doubt, LA has more than nine lives and will rise from the ashes better and brighter than ever.

They reiterated the animals pulled will be those that have been in the shelters as adoptables prior to the fires. We have also been informed that help with and for livestock is the biggest need. The shelters have not been as inundated with small animal intakes as was predicted. We understand The Humane Society of the United States is providing emergency aid to veterinary clinics and local animal welfare organizations.

Petco teams are working with various LA shelters, including LA Animal Services to help get shelter animals either adopted or fostered to open up shelter space. The teams are also helping with trying to reunite pets with their families using the Petco Love Lost app.

Organizations like FieldHaven Feline Center are working hard to set up water and food stations within the burn areas for misplaced pets. Critical as this mission is to saving lives, it has been a tough to accomplish. Law enforcement is not allowing animal rescuers (aka ‚Äúunofficial organizations‚Äù) into the burn areas to search for and get the animals out, or allowing teams in to set up the water and feed stations. ‚ÄúPet owners begging for someone to go to their houses to check for pets are being ignored,‚Äù wrote Joy Smith of FieldHaven Feline Center. ‚ÄúRescuers have a curfew of being out of the fire zone by dark. Very, very few cats will be found in the daylight.‚Äù

Who is in charge? This is not meant to be a judgmental question, but an effort to help and connect. It is a question we keep seeing. There are organizations willing to help. Who should they connect with to receive orders and direction to proceed?

""The Justice Department has concluded the 1921 Tulsa race massacre was a ‚Äúcoordinated, military-style attack‚Äù as the agency released the findings of its investigation, announced last fall. On May 31 and June 1, 1921, white rioters murdered an estimated 300 Black residents of Tulsa, Oklahoma‚Äôs Greenwood neighborhood, known as Black Wall Street, and looted and destroyed their homes and businesses.

The report also states there are no living perpetrators for the Justice Department to prosecute. The last two remaining survivors of the Tulsa race massacre, Viola Fletcher and Lessie Benningfield Randle ‚Äî both 110 years old ‚Äî have been seeking justice and reparations for years. Last year, the Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed their case.""

Because of this, I‚Äôve woven together a tapestry of ideas to help you through this trying time.

First, acknowledge your emotions. Take comfort in the knowledge that it‚Äôs entirely natural to feel what you‚Äôre feeling, and remember that you are cherished and safe. Remember, you cannot pour from an empty cup. This important step must be completed before moving on to anything else.

Next, turn your focus toward the helpers, volunteers, and first responders. Illuminate for yourself the ways neighbors are uniting to foster healing. If you are able, consider joining these noble community efforts. Strive to steer clear of conspiracy theories, tales of looting, and unverified information.

Keep up your normal routines wherever possible. In times of upheaval, a thread of normalcy can weave a calming effect. Treat yourself to a small delight, listen to your favorite music, or indulge in a soothing face mask. Small joys can make a world of difference.

I‚Äôm sending endless love and support to our beloved LA community. Should you need assistance, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to a professional. Take care of yourselves and your families, and let us know how I can help. I am ready to support you.

I spent 6 hours with the men at Fire House 36 on Sunday. Was supposed to just be a ride along, and we did do that, but after the first call, Holloway (who you might remember from my last post about 36) offered to drive me along the route that they took those first 48 hours of the Eaton fire. We drove up past the National Guard, and they walked me through their firefight, neighborhood by neighborhood, house by house‚Ä¶the ones they saved, the ones that were lost, and told me how it all went down. In one of the neighborhoods that was mostly intact, residents wearing N95 masks who were outside in their yards clearing fallen branches and debris waved and blew kisses as the firetruck passed by. It was incredibly moving. 

The mountainside in the background of this photo is where the Eaton fire began, around some massive power lines that you can just see if you look very closely.

I should note that it‚Äôs not safe to go up there, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting to. It‚Äôs blocked off for a reason. Most of what I saw, I saw from the firetruck. We only stopped and exited the truck twice, and we kept it brief. I didn‚Äôt go traipsing around through burned out structures, that‚Äôs a great way to catch a nail in the foot. Also, the air is toxic, in case you haven‚Äôt heard. So consider yourself discouraged.

I‚Äôm still processing everything, after stepping into their world at Fire House 36 yesterday. When I got home last night it felt like coming back from another planet, washing toxic moon dust off my boots... I‚Äôm still going through the photos. 

More on this soon.

While most will health and return to their usual routine, the journey is different for everyone.

For teens, these events can be even harder to process. It‚Äôs normal for them to feel scared, confused, or uncertain. But here‚Äôs the good news: teens are resilient! Even those affected by trauma can recover with the right support.

Create a safe, open space for teens to ask questions and share their feelings. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to have these conversations ‚Äì just listen, be honest, and offer reassurance.

For teens, distress may last longer, and that‚Äôs okay. If feelings anxiety, sadness, or fear don‚Äôt subside after a few weeks, reaching out for support is key.

At Neuro Wellness Spa and Clear Behavioral Health, we specialize in tailored mental health care for teens and their families. Together we can navigate tough times and help your teen heal.

Our prayers go to all those that were affected and feel hopeless in the midst of this tragedy. This experiences itself was one that will forever be embedded into our hearts. Not because of its mark left in history, but because of the impact a group of people can do. Giving out hotdogs and beverages for free may have seemed like a small gesture, yet to many it was received as a huge unexpected Blessing. We thank God for guiding us through the remainings left behind, for making a way to move forward with this plan, and most importantly for giving us his grace to make an impact in these individuals lives. 

Isaiah 43-19: 
‚ÄúSee, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.‚Äù
God will always make a way to those who genuinely seek him and give him an opportunity in their hearts.

Whether we choose to believe that it is the mystery of a benevolent God, or the universe punishing us for some karmic slight-it is a choice.

I myself, haven't decided what I want to choose yet, because  on top of all the personal belongings that burned, my recording studio with all my music equipment was lost, all the artworks I was going to display for the immersive art events I was on the verge of creating were lost, all the display gear, and creative gear, like cameras, tripods, reflectors and lighting, was lost.

Basically, all the big goals I was working for in 2025 is now gone.

I'm not in a place to decide how to proceed yet because my wife and I need to first finish procuring and settling in a new home.

But make no mistake, I will choose a reason this all happened to us, and whatever that choice is, it will empower me.

There's a lot of time left on the 2025 clock, and I still plan on hitting some big goals.

I say this especially for those affected by the fire. I am consciously not using the term victim.

This isn't easy, and I'm not positive 24/7, but I am resilient and that's enough to keep me in the game for now.

And if you're fire affected and don't know how to go about choosing the reason why this is happening to you, DM me.

I'm happy to help you use intention in how you move forward from this traumatic event at no cost with no obligation or selling of anything.

If my ideas resonate, use it, if it's not for you, that's okay to. Either way, your mindset will help or hinder your moves going forward.

Take great care of it to take the best care of you and your loved ones.

On the evening of January 7, the Eaton fire broke out about 1.5 miles from our front door (in this photo). Within a couple of hours, my son and I were evacuating with our dog and cat and as many belongings as we could think to grab. A couple of days later the National Guard allowed me to return for a brief visit, and I discovered that while our fence had burned down, our house was still standing and all the snakes were fine. I added shipping heat packs to their enclosures since overnight temperatures were cold and we would be without power for several more days, and repeated this again days later on another visit. Eventually, we were allowed to return and clean up the messes that awaited outside. Other houses on our street above and below us in the foothills of Sierra Madre (near Altadena) burned down, but we were fortunate to only lose our fence and lots of our food and rodents that spoiled without power. I want to give a big shout out to Big Cheese Rodent Factory for offering to replace all the rodents we lost at no cost and another shout out of thanks to Showcase Serpents @showcaseserpents for their willingness to refund me in full for a snake I had just paid for so that I can redirect those funds to more urgent needs for now. To everyone else, we are still in business and our babies are doing great! Thanks for all the love and support. ~ Lindsay and Will

It was the first time we were able to get up to Altadena and see our property. Our neighborhood is unrecognizable. The initial, heaving sobs that took my breath away quickly turned into a numb feeling and disbelief at the devastation. But despite all this, it still felt like home. 

The walls of our house collapsed inward and took everything. Books, a 26 year old vinyl collection, Tom‚Äôs tremendous studio, instruments, gear, my lovely plant babies, years of collected crafts, wool, thread, beads, my jewelry making supplies, trinkets from everywhere, friends‚Äô artwork, and the best nap taking couch in the world. Amid the ash there are a few recognizable items: a soapstone statuette on the mantel, that ubiquitous IKEA tea light lantern in the fireplace, a WWI helmet from my Grandfather‚Äôs hat collection, a mixing bowl, and my cheese grater! 

We were so in love with our little home. It was cozy, warm, and hopefully welcoming to everyone who walked through our door. We will collect again, we will replace, and we will rebuild. We are STILL in love with Altadena. It is a magical place and we are heartbroken for our friends, neighbors, and community. We are so incredibly lucky to have the support network that we do and better means than most, but this will still be a very long and arduous road for everyone affected. To the folks of LA and beyond that have stepped up, thank you!! Please keep telling people‚Äôs stories, keep mobilizing, and keep being kind to each other. Help will still be needed in the weeks and months from now. We are eager to find a semipermanent place to settle soon and start helping our community rebuild.  #beautifulaltadena #wewillgethroughthis #eatonfire #altadena",2025-01-21 04:57:33+00:00

I was fortunate to photograph both of these homes for @teresafullerrealestate in their full glory, capturing their beauty and history before this heartbreaking loss. 

The Andrew McNally House, built in 1887, was an architectural masterpiece and a symbol of grandeur. Commissioned by Andrew McNally, co-founder of Rand McNally, this Queen Anne Victorian home was a marvel. My favorite features:
‚Ä®‚ú® A Turkish Room, an aviary, and a third-story turret offering views from the San Gabriel Mountains to Catalina.
‚Ä®‚ú® Intricate carved woodwork, stunning stained glass, ornate bronze radiators, and a breathtaking grand staircase.

physically, I'm okay. yet it's still affecting my mental and emotional so much.

it hurts to know people you know are impacted, it hurts to see some of my strongest friends hurting. I'm coming up on 9 years living here and even though I wasn't born here, it feels like home and it's so hard watching your city be reduced to ashes. I wish I could give back to the places what brought me so much memories and peace.

LA is made up of so much more than rich people and celebrities. if anything, there's more people that are in or closer to poverty than to being a millionaire.

LA is made up of educators, grocery store workers, bus drivers and folks working multiple jobs to get by, just like any other city. but the most beautiful thing about LA is it is such a melting pot of so many diverse generations who grew up here or chose to move here to fight for their biggest dreams.

and just like that we saw an overflow of love. unity in communities of people with open arms doing anything they could to provide and stay strong for those who couldn't.

los angeles, I love you and I will always remember you this way.

While the fires have almost stopped burning, there‚Äôs still an extremely long road ahead for the families and businesses affected by the fires. Ones that burned need help rebuilding, and the ones that are still standing are currently unliveable due to toxins and ash and will need help with clean up. We want to continue to be as helpful as we can to our community up in Altadena. Going forward we will continue to collect and distribute donations and with sales of our hats and totes (+ maybe more designs for Altadena in the future). As for sales from our earrings for now we have to stop donating those and start working towards making enough money to set up our new workshop and get our operations back in order. If we can help more in the future after that we def will!

After her community was devastated by fires, Avery launched the Altadena Girls Recovery Fund (@altadenagirls) to support those impacted. What began as a small effort has now turned into a powerful movement, rallying people together to rebuild and heal. 

Avery's school, Eliot Arts Magnet Academy (@eliotartsmagnet) in Altadena, Calif., burned down in the Eaton Fire. Though her family home in Pasadena fortunately survived, most of her friends lost everything. ‚ÄúThere's maybe a small handful of people I know whose houses are spared,‚Äù she says in an interview with Time Magazine. Most of her friends evacuated in the middle of the night with only the pajamas they were in. ‚ÄúI envisioned my own bedroom and I was thinking about how my clothes, makeup, and shoes‚Äîeverything‚Äîis my identity and it's my sense of self. And it's the same thing for all of my friends and all these girls who lost everything in the fire.‚Äù Colvert wanted her friends to be able to feel normal again. ‚ÄúI was like, okay, Pasadena Civic Center has the necessities, but I want specific items for these girls so they can feel like themselves again and get their confidence back,‚Äù she says.

Avery organized donation drives, collecting essential supplies like food, clothing, and hygiene products but also items like makeup, clothes reflecting current teen trends, and other cherished teen memorabilia that many lost in the fires.

This extended period will allow the school to regroup and rebuild while ensuring minimal disruption to academic instruction for the year.

We reached out to our friends at Sahag Mesrob Armenian Christian School within the early moments of this tragedy to assure them that they can count on us for support,‚Äù he added.

In a public statement, the Sahag Mesrob Armenian Christian School board affirmed its determination to rebuild, and its Chair, Arlin Titanian, expressed profound gratitude to AGBU for the partnership it forged overnight.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rare to encounter such a strong and compassionate partner, and AGBU‚Äôs commitment to supporting us has not gone unnoticed. We are incredibly fortunate to have you by our side; in unity is strength,‚Äù said Titanian.

Social media and news outlets erupted in applause‚Äîand rightfully so. These men risked their lives to save homes and lives for about a dollar an hour. üßë‚Äçüöíüî•

But as the smoke clears, a harsh truth emerges: these same men‚Äîpraised for their heroism‚Äîwill soon face rejection. They‚Äôll struggle to find jobs, housing, or basic acceptance in the very communities they just helped protect. üè†

If we, as a society, can celebrate someone‚Äôs redemption in a moment of crisis, why can‚Äôt we extend that same grace and opportunity once the crisis is over? The same voices applauding them today will deny them tomorrow. The same networks praising them now will vilify them later. üíî

As a business owner (www.saywt.com) and ministry founder (brand316.org), I challenge you: extend the second chances you‚Äôve been given in life to others. ‚úÖ When hiring, look beyond someone‚Äôs record and see the whole person. As a landlord, consider their humanity before dismissing them. As a fellow human being, remember they are someone‚Äôs son, daughter, father, or mother. üí°

We all make mistakes. We all need second chances. Let your first assumption be that they are one of the firefighters üí™ who saved a community. Everyone deserves the chance to rewrite their story. ‚úçÔ∏è 

Most business owners and landlords (including myself) that have taken this chance have realized it was well worth it.  People with records tend to be better employees, more appreciative of the chance you extended and more loyal to your company.

Who are we without the walls that held our laughter? Without the streets that mapped our lives? It‚Äôs not just about rebuilding structures; it‚Äôs about rediscovering ourselves in the aftermath of what‚Äôs been lost.

In Los Angeles, and in every place where devastation has carved its name into the landscape, we carry a shared ache‚Äîan ache that whispers of everything that once was. But loss is not the final word. We rise, not because it‚Äôs easy, but because we must. Recovery isn‚Äôt built in grand gestures, but in the quiet, intentional choices we make, one step, one breath, one small act of courage at a time.

The fire may have taken what we had, but it cannot take who we are. We are more than what we lost. We are what we choose to become.

Central Altadena Little League (CALL) was severely impacted by the Eaton Fire that began on January 7.

The @playcentralaltadena Board estimates that between 1/3-1/2 of their families have lost their homes, and their home fields are inaccessible. But these amazing families are still doing what they can to put on a Spring season for their players ‚Äî and we are calling all Vipers to do what they can to help out!!

CALL is looking for the following to help players AND coaches to have the best season they can in spite of these tragic circumstances:

‚öæÔ∏è Gift Cards to Major Sports Stores (Dick‚Äôs, Big 5, Play it Again, Amazon). These can be used to fill in specific gear needs for either players or coaches that get missed in donations or are more niche (e.g. left handed gloves, clothing needs, etc.).

‚öæÔ∏è Coach Gear: Many of their coaches were also impacted and lost both their personal gear as well as their league bags.¬†Specific equipment needs include:
* Baseball Nets
* Baseball Tees
* Baseballs (T-balls, Level 5 Safety Balls, Little League balls)

‚öæÔ∏è Monetary donations are welcomed as well, and can be made via the CALL GoFundMe ‚Äî https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-callkids-affected-by-eaton-fires. These funds give the league flexibility to help support scholarships for impacted players or repairing infrastructure that may have been damaged in the fires. The league is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit.

We will be coordinating and collecting donations and ask that all items/gift cards be donated by Saturday, February 1.

For questions or more info on how to help, please DM us or email us at coachjlo@villaparkvipers.com.

The recent Eaton Wildfire in Los Angeles County forced many to evacuate, with some losing their homes. We were among those affected, spending 5 days in evacuation and 5 more without power.

We feel incredibly lucky to have returned to work and fully recovered our production speed. There are no more delays, and we‚Äôre back to creating your personalized gifts with the same passion and dedication.

üß°We truly appreciate your support, patience, and understanding during this challenging time. Every order means the world to us, and we‚Äôre grateful for this amazing community.

What can I possibly do to make a difference in the face of such devastation? ‚Ä¶ They need nutritious, fueling meals while fighting these fires for days and WEEKS at a time. What can I do to ease the burden for those who lost EVERYTHING? At least feed them.

Over 1,000 healthy meals were prepped and hand-delivered to over 40 fire stations, police departments, state troopers, and shelters for displaced residents affected by the Los Angeles wildfires.

I‚Äôm beyond grateful to the hardworking front-liners who continue to protect and serve us, and to the incredible LA community for coming together in the face of tragedy. 

Thanks to the generosity of hundreds of individuals who donated. Your kindness and support made this possible.

This is why I started B Fit Meals‚Äîto help others when it matters most. As LA rebuilds, we‚Äôre committed to fundraising weekly meals to support families in need. This is just the beginning.

My thoughts and prayers are with all those impacted by this national disaster. Stay strong, LA ü´∂

Sin embargo, la mayor√≠a de modelos meteorol√≥gicos coinciden que tendremos ambiente invernal en la regi√≥n tras el descenso de un sistema de baja presi√≥n desde Canad√°, el cual provocar√° un desplome notorio en las temperaturas m√°ximas, aire √°rtico, y potencialmente descargas de precipitaci√≥n ligera, tanto l√≠quida como s√≥lida, de manera generalizada. 

¬øCuando?
Las precipitaciones comenzar√≠an el S√°bado 4:00 AM extendi√©ndose hasta el lunes por la madrugada.

¬øPotencia de tormenta?
D√©bil en naturaleza. Acumulados de lluvia menos de 0.50‚Äù pulgadas y solamente trazas de nieve.

¬øBeneficio?
Las lloviznas ayudar√°n con la contenci√≥n de los incendios #palisadesfire #eatonfire as√≠ como combatir la sequ√≠a que nuevamente enfrenta el estado.

Red-tail is an Indigenous dancer, ritualist, and longtime member of the LAPP artist community.

Most recently, Red-tail participated in our ACCELERATOR program to resource an ensemble dance performance at REDCAT.

In January of 2025, Red-tail‚Äôs Altadena family lost their home and all their belongings in the Eaton fire. They are now facing the enormous challenge of rebuilding their lives, while Red-tail is also currently recovering from breast cancer surgery. Our hearts are with the Lollie family, and we encourage you to donate to their GoFundMe, send gift cards as requested, and share their story with those who may be able to help.

All members of our LAPP community who are facing hardships as a result of the January 2025 wildfires are invited to fill out the Artist Survey linked in our bio, with which we are gathering information to fill in gaps in artist relief and support.

I looked for something, anything that was identifiable. And most of the time, I couldn't find a single item. Nothing but ash. 

When I was able to find something, I discovered that one person loves the color yellow - especially lemons. Another is extremely whimsical and loves fantastical creatures. Another is devout. Another absolutely loves animals.

Every single one of these homes you see in the vast landscape of destruction represents lives forever changed... it's very easy to become numb to it, oftentimes as a coping mechanism.  At one point, I even felt myself becoming unable to cry any more. 

But, in the eerie silence of the evacuation zones, these are all small moments that gave me pause - stirring up emotion and serving as a reminder that there is a person to whom these objects matter, and will most likely serve as one of the only memories that remain from what they've lost.

Trust and believe that brighter days are ahead for all of us.

Since all of the usual tasks of feeding, cleaning, watering, and walking were all taken care of, they were given their bracelets and tasked with the simple, but important task of ‚Äúcomforting and loving‚Äù the horses. Something they did naturally. It was so beautiful to see the horses light up with curiosity in their presence, and as soon as we got in the car, each kid knew the name of the horse they fell in love with. That is the magic of horses. They are reflective and the love and comfort is always reciprocated. üôèüèºüê¥

I met some amazing firefighters who drove down from Portland, Oregon to fight the fires in the Palisades. 
Photograph several blue vehicles that made it through the infernos. 
Saw a beautiful statue of a winged goddess that was the only thing left at someone‚Äôs beach home. 
Viewed the devastation from some vistas that used to be bucolic. 
Photographed with a Leica M6 using 21, and 50mm cron lenses.

You can surround them with their friends.

You can listen to what they're going through.

You can send them jokes, memes, or photos you know will make them laugh, even if it's coming through tears.

And you know what?

Simply saying, ""I'm here for you has a healing touch even if they don't take you up on the offer. 

Just like a person can feel alone in a crowd, so to can a person feel held in a room alone.

Yes, we may need 'things', but tending to the mental health of the affected?

That's no small thing.

In fact, without that, all those 'things' aren't likely to have the desired affect anyhow.

We are looking to provide ANYTHING HAT related....whether it be hats themselves, vintage and new, tools, blocks, flanges, trinkets, antiques, signs, hat bands, vintage pins, etc.  Besides donations of hat items specifically,  we will be accepting, cash and digital payments on behalf of the Wellema's that 100% of the proceeds will go directly to the family...PLUS, a portion of RVP sales on this day will also be presented to the Wellema's.

It was called something like ""Unidentified Animal"" and was installed at an amusement park/hot springs in Nagano, but was soon destroyed in an earthquake.

Ci siamo conosciuti nel 2006, in Accademia, quando eravamo ancora due ragazzini e abbiamo condiviso gli anni pi√π spensierati delle nostre vite; da allora non ci siamo mai persi, nonostante 15 anni fa io mi sia trasferita a Roma e lui a LA, entrambi con il sogno di sfondare nel cinema.
Be‚Äô dieci giorni fa Alessandro ha perso tutto quello che aveva negli incendi che hanno devastato LA. 
Mi ha scritto: ‚ÄúSIAMO VIVI. Ma abbiamo perso tutto‚Äù. 
Non riesco nemmeno immaginare cosa significhi ‚Äúperdere tutto‚Äù. 
La tua casa. I tuoi vestiti. Gli oggetti che ti porti dietro da sempre. I ricordi. La foto di tuo fratello o quel biglietto di auguri che ti fa piangere ogni volta che lo leggi. Tutto quello che faceva di te quello che sei, quello che sei stato e quello che speravi di diventare. Spazzato via. Distrutto. Ridotto in cenere.
Ora. Perch√© questo messaggio. Perch√© Ale e la sua famiglia hanno bisogno di aiuto per comprare beni di prima necessit√†, vestiti, oggetti, mobili, oltre che di una casa in affitto. Per questo hanno lanciato una campagna su Go Found Me per avviare una raccolta fondi. 
Quindi io mi rivolgo a voi, che siete amici, o conoscenti, o sconosciuti, e vi chiedo con il cuore in mano se potete contribuire a questa raccolta. Anche in modo piccolo, anche in modo simbolico, perch√© ogni singola goccia, assieme ad altre gocce, pu√≤ diventare un immenso, meraviglioso oceano di solidariet√†. 
In un mondo attualmente devastato da guerre, morti, macerie ed eventi climatici terrificanti, ci tengo a ringraziare dal profondo del mio cuore tutti quelli che vorranno contribuire a questa raccolta fondi o che avranno voglia di condividere questo messaggio. Perch√© l‚Äôunico modo per sopravvivere a questo specifico momento storico, fatto di guerre, morti, macerie, e cambiamenti climatici devastanti, √® non lasciarci soli l‚Äôun l‚Äôaltra.

Ale ti voglio bene. Siete fortissimi. Viva la resilienza.

Wonderful article about rebuilding after megafire, and the necessary joy found in community. 

We love this one, for many reasons. It includes some wondrous humans, like Gabe Osburn with the City of Santa Rosa, and Brad Sherwood, Community Leader, and his family.

""Fire wasn‚Äôt supposed to do what it did that night. No one had predicted the flames would move so fast, or consume so much of this city of 175,000 and surrounding communities. No one could have predicted, either, that Santa Rosa would manage to build back so quickly, or that residents would say that, in some ways, their communities emerged stronger: safer from fire and more closely knit.

Just more than a week into Los Angeles‚Äô ordeal by fire, the neighbors of Coffey Park were gathering in Tricia Woods‚Äô rebuilt kitchen to raise funds to send to fire victims in L.A. They also wanted to send a message: You can‚Äôt imagine it now, but it is possible to recover from this.""

You can recover, rebuild, and reimagine

In the meantime, reminding myself that rest is radical and grief tending is essential. I‚Äôm sending so much love to all our friends and community as we start down the long road of repair üôåüèΩ #eatonfire",2025-01-22 16:46:42+00:00

Growing up, my mom had a way of turning our backyard into a wonderland. She filled every corner with love, laughter, and creativity. For me and my sister, it was a world of endless mornings full of adventure, picnics, and the kind of magic only a mom can create.

That same magic came alive again when her grandchildren stepped into that space. Watching them explore, play, and dream in the backyard my parents built with their hands and hearts was like reliving my own childhood.

But now, that magical oasis is gone. The place that held decades of memories and joy has been taken away. My parents poured so much love into that home, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking to see them have to start over.

We‚Äôre asking for your support as they search for a new place to call home‚Äîa place where they can create new memories, where the magic can live on. Whether it‚Äôs words of encouragement, a kind gesture, or simply keeping them in your thoughts, it means everything.

I didn‚Äôt have electricity at the property for over 2.5 years while dealing with the insurance paperwork and fighting for the release of funds, but with the help of solar panels and a @jackeryusa it worked (sort of!). Cold showers in the summer, and hot water at the gym was better than no shower at all. I gutted the closet shelves in the trailer and made space for a tall cat tree, made a cat door for the storage benches where I put the litter box, and built an outdoor canopied living space to call home. 

If you‚Äôre looking to give back to support all the displaced families and pets, would you consider supporting our fundraiser for @gonetothedogsrescue as they prepare to save more dogs from local shelters to make space for displaced animals from the recent fires?

We ventured back to our house in Altadena yesterday, where we spent a few hours digging through the ashes of a lifetime of memories. We learned that almost nothing survives a wildfire of this magnitude‚Ä¶. besides pottery‚Ä¶. I was ecstatic to find about a quarter of my pieces were still intact, and ironically (and morbidly), the heat of the #EatonFire created some beautiful glaze and material combinations. I‚Äôll share more later, but this was the largest vase I made back in September 2023, that I wanted to use for flower arrangements  @perle_restaurant but never liked the original glaze. Now it‚Äôs no longer waterproof ‚Äî it had been sitting on a glass shelf awaiting a refiring with a new coat of glaze. When that shelf inevitably melted from the heat of the flames, the vase and glass, along with sediment from the earth when it fell, became one.

After 15 years of living in Altadena growing up and going to school there was the I met my best friends, loving neighbors, and amazing families. Now with all our hard work and sacrifice, we had just rebuilt our new home, in a little gem city, only to watch it and everything inside it consumed by the destructive flames. My home was a place of kindness, if you knew or already been to our home it is filled with countless memories and love, truly because of all of YOU. Sadly, this loss isn‚Äôt ours alone. 

Anthony‚Äôs (my dad) brother, along with his family, also lost their home in the fire.
As we navigate this overwhelming hardship, the Nazarians are filled with gratitude for the love and support we‚Äôve received from friends, family, and our community. While our hearts are heavy, we are determined to staying strong and  moving forward with whatever God has next for us, knowing that with the help of those around us, we all will get through this difficult time together.

With sincere appreciation, the Nazarian family asks for any donations, big or small, as we begin the process of rebuilding our lives. Every gesture of kindness means the world to us during this challenging time. With love and support, we know that we all will rise from this tragedy stronger than before.

Our gofundme link is in my bio 
Again we want to send love, and thank everyone who‚Äôs helped us through an unseeing time. It doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed.

For many residents, warning of the approaching firestorm came either very late, or not at all.

Those who lived west of North Lake Avenue said they didn‚Äôt get evacuation orders until about 3:30 a.m., and received no electronic warnings. At that point, as residents frantically tried to evacuate, fire embers were already sweeping across homes.

An investigation by The Los Angeles Times published on Sunday found that all of the 17 Eaton Fire deaths currently recorded by the LA coroner occurred west of Lake Ave.

Today, we received an incredible in-kind donation from @luminaid , who generously provided hundreds of solar-powered lanterns and phone chargers to help those affected by the fires. These lanterns are lightweight, waterproof, and collapsible, making them perfect for emergencies. They charge during the day using solar power and provide hours of bright light at night, with a built-in phone charger to help people stay connected when it matters most.

These invaluable tools will bring light and connection to our community and are heading straight to the front lines in Altadena, where residents are beginning to repopulate and clean up after the devastation.

The Hughes Fire, just like the ones that ignited before it, exploded in size in the high winds of Southern California, spreading to more than 5,000 acres in just two hours after it was first reported near Castaic Lake.

The Palisades Fire, which has burned more than 23,400 acres, remains at less than 70% containment, while the Eaton Fire, which has burned just over 14,000 acres, is just over 90% contained, according to Cal Fire.

While we have all been watching the Palisades and Altadena communities suffer immeasurable loss to fires, my heart and head have been a mess, as I grew up in Northwest Pasadena , and my childhood was filled with magical Altadena memories.

I literally learned how to use the MLS one week ago, and within days I was scrambling to help families find rental homes. 

I did my first deal this weekend, and got an amazing family who lost everything in the #Eatonfire into a great rental house in Highland Park, they get keys on Friday! ü§ó

What a week to start this journey. I feel so grateful to be able to help and support these people through such an unimaginable time, and get some folks the housing they need to start a new chapter.

I am forever an optimist , and I believe that communities will always come together to make things right - we have all seen it unfold before our eyes already! 

I have high hopes for the future, and I am grateful to have this new journey of my own, with an amazing mentor @msmarydix  and all my fiends and family cheering me on!

Residents in the surrounding area are urged to wear P100 or N95 masks. Over 50,000 people were under evacuation orders or warnings as a massive wildfire swept through rugged mountains north of Los Angeles, fueled by strong winds. The Hughes Fire, which started in the late morning, burned over 15 square miles of trees and brush, sending up dark smoke plumes near Lake Castaic. LA County Sheriff Robert Luna reported that 31,000 people have been ordered to evacuate, with 23,000 under evacuation warnings. Firefighters are gaining ground in containing the blaze, which remains challenging. Parts of Interstate 5, previously closed, will be reopened shortly, according to Luna.  #eatonfire #southerncalifornia #wildfire #breakingnews #airquality",2025-01-23 10:42:47+00:00

I had repeated nightmares about the Hughes Fire somehow making its way to where I am.

Today I get to go to the dentist, an appointment I made 6 months ago and am actually keeping even though my world is topsyturvy. I need something normal to do- something not related to replacing foods, attending fire-related events, memory searching, or filling out neverending forms.

Alongside her courageous 16-year-old son, Cristina drove toward the inferno to evacuate their three horses, while her husband evacuated their three dogs, two cats, and gathered belongings from their home in Hastings Ranch. 

The ten-acre brush fire spread rapidly through Eaton Canyon. Cristina and her son arrived just in time, and as they loaded the horses into the trailer, her husband faced a lawn full of embers and 90-mph winds. Miraculously, the house was spared, but their barn burned to the ground.

Blondie, Cash, and Cinco were temporarily housed elsewhere until space became available at the equestrian center, where we caught up with Cristina. She shared details of the evacuation, describing her thoughts as she led the horses to safety. She noted how calm three-year-old Cinco remained during the intense situation and knew she had to stay steady as well.

At @sanctuary_doc mindfulness is a core value that strengthens our ability to document animal rescues while also finding sanctuary within. As we stood with Cristina and reflected on her experience, we asked what sanctuary meant to her. Cristina described sanctuary as a place of peace, silence, and renewal.

After leaving LA, I followed up with Cristina. She shared how a long-standing meditation practice helped her navigate that harrowing night:

‚ÄúMy practice SAVED me that night... I felt like my consciousness was trying to shatter that night as I was evacuating horses, and my practice kept me intact!‚Äù

After the barn burned, Cristina received a note from her meditation teacher containing a haiku by 17th-century poet Mizuta Masahide written after his own barn was destroyed:

‚ÄúBarn‚Äôs burnt down, now I can see the moon.‚Äù

This week, the family picked up two cats from @pasadenahumane who had been rescued from the barn and will foster them for the time being. Their three dogs and two cats have been with them since the fire. 

‚ù§Ô∏è We send our heartfelt wishes to Cristina‚Äôs human and nonhuman family as they heal and rebuild.

Our house, and my studio, sit just a couple of blocks below the border of Altadena, in Pasadena, and we were extremely fortunate our little pocket did not burn. 

But our property did sustain pretty major smoke and ash damage due to the proximity to the fire, and our very old, uninsulated louvre windows. The wind also blew open doors, and covered everything in toxic house fire ash, full of arsenic, titanium, lead & other heavy metals, making the house unsafe to live in without major rehabilitation. 

We evacuated that night with our best friends, and after spending a couple of nights at my mother in laws house, we went and camped at the beach. Our best friends were sadly one of the many who lost their home and all that they own and the slow realization of that was devastating. 

The past couple of weeks have been a chaotic gathering and sorting of information, full of deep grief for our community, scrambling to support everyone we can while figuring out our own living situation and the kids schooling, and overwhelmed by confusion and fear for our health as to whether we now go back and live so close to all that toxic devastation. 

Our house is currently being restored and deep cleaned which will take a few weeks, and we are staying in an air bnb. The kids schools have found new locations and will be reopening at the end of the month. 

I have personally been having a bit of an existential crisis. I know there are always silver linings, and can already see so many. So much generosity, strength and community bonding. But the panic planning, exhaustion and stress has been real. And my heart just breaks over and over for those in our neighbourhood who have lost all of their belongings, despite my deep knowing that there are always reasons for everything.

Designed by architect Greg Chasen, it weathered the flames with materials and strategies built for resilience. üåüüî•

Here‚Äôs how it withstood the flames:

‚úÖ Fire-Safe Materials
* üß± Solid concrete walls blocked flames and provided a strong foundation.
* üõ°Ô∏è A metal roof with fire-resistant underlayment stopped embers from penetrating.
* ü™ü Tempered glass windows didn‚Äôt shatter under extreme heat, keeping fire and smoke out.
* üåæ Defensible space: No vegetation near the house + concrete garden walls.

‚úÖ Smart Design
* üö´ No eaves, overhangs, or attic vents that could let sparks in.
* üîí Airtight construction stopped embers from sneaking inside.
* üå¨Ô∏è Special ventilation systems filtered out smoke, keeping the air safe to breathe.

This home shows what‚Äôs possible with thoughtful home design and a focus on resilience. It‚Äôs also inspired me on my own journey to build a wildfire-resilient, solar-powered home in San Diego. üå±‚òÄÔ∏è

Yesterday I met with a family in LA who lost their home and their entire community of Altadena in the wildfires. Their kids school burned down as well üíî They want to build a climate-resilient home that is wildfire-safe and net-zero energy. We also hope to help the entire community build back more resilient. üè°üíö

Our hearts go out to our beloved cities of Altadena, Pacific Palisades and everyone affected during these tragic times. We‚Äôve been working behind the scenes, assisting in any way we can, but it‚Äôs time to put our expertise to use. 

Rebuilding the cities of Altadena and Pacific Palisades won‚Äôt be an easy task and for many it will be the first time building something from ground up, as well as, dealing with insurance companies. Please do not rush into anything and talk to experts. We would love to help you and your families make rebuilding process as worry free as possible and offer some major discounts to help during this tragedy. Our goal is to provide any assistance whether it be discounts, working with insurance, simply answering questions or anything else our community may need when rebuilding. 

We also want to warn the community about possible price gouging and scams that might take place and we are keeping our lines open for any questions. If something seems off please double check with another credible source and don‚Äôt get scammed by any unlicensed or untrustworthy ‚Äúcontractors‚Äù. When in doubt - reach out. 

If you or someone you know, needs assistance, please reach out. My wife and I are here for you. 

We are with you, Altadena!

It was one of the first places in LA County where Black people could own property at a time when redlining and segregation were widespread in the California real estate market. It grew into a multicultural town on the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, a place where historically underrepresented people could live and thrive. Altadena chose not to incorporate as a city, as well as not to be annexed by Pasadena, because they prefer a lighter political oversight. They are a community with the amenities of a city, a haven of integration and creativity. And they have been completely overwhelmed by the recent Eaton Fire that destroyed nearly the entire town.

Firefighter Keith Williams of Station 36 stands on the front steps of one of the homes that was lost in the fire. They managed to save three houses in a row on the other side of the street, but this house, the one next door, and another across the street perished. 

Williams showed me videos on his phone of the inferno as it played out on this block. One video, taken of the backyard of this very house, showed thousands of burning embers, darting around on the wind like a hail of fireflies. 

I‚Äôm in awe of the bravery of these guys. But if you say that to them, of course, they shrug and say ‚ÄúJust doing my job.‚Äù 

The slogan you find all over Fire House 36 is ‚ÄòNot For The Weak‚Äô.

Hello dear friends, how are you holding up out there? Hopefully things in other parts of the country are not quite as stingy to the eyes as they are here. We continue to go up in flames, but our spirits remain. 

Among the many historically significant architectural sites I feared was lost in the Eaton fire was the beautiful Theosophical Society Estate. 

I tripped upon it while on one of my many walks in the area, and couldn't help but sneak in, despite the fact that I felt I was, perhaps, trespassing. The gate was wide open, the impressive winding long driveway beckoned to me, and, well, I just couldn't help myself. 

Here you can see the various views that I was able to capture without ruffling feathers. It definitely had an elevated and important feel to it. Here are some things I found out:

From Altadena Historical Society, published in 2014:

Altadena‚Äôs best kept secret is the Theosophical Society. The organization has been headquartered in Altadena since 1951, housed in two local historic buildings. 

Founded in New York in 1875, the non-sectarian organization went through more than a few hostile schisms, too numerous to mention here, but definitely interesting reading if you like gossip. 

According to the society‚Äôs literature, today the organization is a ‚Äúworldwide association dedicated to uplifting humanity through a better understanding of oneness of life and the practical application of brotherhood. Unsectarian and nonpolitical, the objectives are:

to form an active brotherhood among mankind;
to promulgate the essential unity of all that is, and to demonstrate that this unity is fundamental in nature;
to promote the study of ancient and modern religion, science, and philosophy;
to explore the hidden side of nature and mankind.‚Äù

The Society‚Äôs International Headquarters is located in a grand old house at the northeast corner of Mariposa and Santa Rosa Avenue. It‚Äôs the last of three significant homes built on the same millionaire‚Äôs row.""

I thought it was gone, but re-examining the maps, I think not! Their library on Lake sadly burned - a great loss of books and archives, but this estate seems safe! :)",2025-01-24 02:07:16+00:00

She entered the LAFD in 1998, when she ""placed among the top 50 scores out of 16,000 applicants,"" the dept. told City News Service. She rose ""through the ranks as firefighter, firefighter paramedic, engineer, fire inspector, captain I, captain II, battalion chief, assistant chief,"" CNS continues, becoming LAFD's 1st woman fire marshal and 2nd woman deputy chief. She is now LAFD's 1st woman and 1st openly queer (lesbian) chief. 

Crowley's appointment to chief came amidst alarm about hazing and other harassment of women firefighters in the LAFD and across the nation, with women quitting rather than reporting abuse, for fear of retaliation. ""A highly anticipated survey of the LAFD's workplace culture released in November [2021] found that more than half of female firefighters reported bullying and harassment as sources of conflict,‚Äù The LA Times summarized. ""Just 13% of female firefighters believe the LAFD is interested in their well-being, the survey found."" As of Jan. 2022, the dept only had 117 women firefighters, making up just 3.5% of the LAFD. 

Like any minority in a given field, those few women have persevered by being extra good at what they do #burdenofrepresentation, such that their 3.5% holds 10% of leadership positions, according to then-Mayor Garcetti upon his appointment of Crowley. Unfortunately, such success makes it very easy for detractors to chock up their leadership to tokenism, as we have heard directed at Crowley during these fires. 

The media-hyped anonymous letter from alleged ‚Äúretired and active LAFD chief officers"" particularly took issue with Crowley speaking out against LAFD budget cuts made by City Hall--that she spoke out while fighting these major fires, as if she was politicking rather than focusing on her work. Crowley's ""outburst"" has actually brought her further respect within the LAFD, as previous chiefs have been shy of criticizing their own boss, the mayor. It showed that she is not, in fact, interested in politics. It also brought public attention to the LAFD budget, especially in contrast to the LAPD‚Äôs. #priorities",2025-01-24 02:28:38+00:00

A home, not a house, that her parents poured their hearts into. A home filled with decades of memories reduced to ashes in minutes by the Eaton fire.

Standing on top of rubble today where Nataly once shared her most precious moments with her family, she told me of her late father‚Äôs love for their home, the love of the mountain views pressed against the Pasadena sky‚Ä¶and looking up at that sky, she tearfully said, ‚ÄúDad, we will rebuild in your honor.‚Äù

As reporters we cover tragedies daily‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs rare that we become part of the tragedy. To have to tell the stories of devastation while your own home is burning takes courage, strength, and dedication to duty.

Sifting through the ashes this afternoon, she found her dad‚Äôs harmonica-slightly charred but still recognizable. His spirit was the foundation of that home and the foundation she will use to remember, reconcile, and rebuild. #eatonfire @knxnews #lastrong

AND ALTADENA @WALKGOODLA ‚Ä¶WE WILL AMPLIFY THE WORK. 
-
Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @walkgoodla LA, it‚Äôs time to take charge of your health now. 

We are in unprecedented territory as the burn zone has well surpassed the size of San Francisco. It‚Äôs important that we are all aware as a community that urban fires bring different challenges. It‚Äôs also important that we stay collected. We look to 9/11 and the Lahaina fires as examples of how smoke and ash exposure can lead to long term health consequences within the affected population. Think of all of the material in a home, on a car, in a business or old building. Those chemicals and components are now in the ash that we see collecting on surfaces in LA. 

And while we have a human urge to return to normalcy so quickly, we should first ask ourselves if it is safe to do so. 

Slide 5 contains current best practices that we know of so far. There is a public webinar occurring tomorrow 1.24 at 3pm PT from the Coalition of Clean Air. They will have new insights on air quality, water safety and hazardous waste, with a panel of experts to answer your questions. The panel includes representatives from South Coast Air Quality Mgmt District, Dept of Toxic Substances Control and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Link in the bio to register for the webinar. We will also be taking notes and making them available for the community ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíö

If you must go outside, use your best judgment and take the necessary preventative health measures currently available ü´Ç

I don‚Äôt know how to even begin thanking everyone friends, family, and kind strangers who have helped us along this difficult road.  I would truly be lost without you.  It is you all that give me the strength to move forward and make sure my family and I come out of this stronger people. üôè 

@alan5benavente and I worked so hard, sacrificed so much and put our heart and soul and everything we had into building our home that we lost.  It wasn‚Äôt just a house or items we lost, it was our vision of heaven, a paradise we built and a beautiful future we envisioned there.  We deeply loved our home, neighborhood, neighbors and entire community. 

All the donations people have been generously giving really give us a glimmer of hope that we will be able to get through this and get back to a place of comfort and sanctuary one day.

Well, the world is going to keep throwing curveballs at us whether we like it or not. It‚Äôs our own responsibility to ground and recharge so we don‚Äôt fizzle away. 

Take a look around. It‚Äôs not 2019 anymore, and there‚Äôs no going back to the world we once knew. (Keep an open mind now‚Ä¶)

The structures, systems, and beliefs that once felt solid are shifting beneath our feet, asking us to evolve alongside them.

From wildfire pollutants to everyday exposure, our pets face invisible challenges that don‚Äôt just affect their lungs‚Äîthey can enter the bloodstream, fuel inflammation, and strain their overall health.

Here‚Äôs the good news: their bodies are designed to detox, and with the right support, you can help optimize those processes! üå±

Supplements like curcumin, sulforaphane (from broccoli, check out our past reel on broccoli and how to prepare it for your pet), chlorella, and milk thistle strengthen liver function, while NAC promotes glutathione production (the body‚Äôs master antioxidant) and supports lung health by breaking down mucus.

For me, the way light enters a room can reset my mood.

It's a way to keep me in the present moment and I usually use it as a time to remind myself that I am loved and I am safe.

Sometimes, I consider how far I've come along in life from my teenaged years where I figured I'd be dead or in jail by now.

I didn't anticipate a future with the luxury of sitting in a room and making its natural light my biggest concern.

The light you need will most likely be different.

Look for it when you can.

About ten minutes ago is the first time since the fire I've been able to indulge. And it has been a battle to get here.

So give yourself grace if you're not there yet. Just keep it as a loose goal that when you get that space, you'll give yourself a few moments with whatever light you have at your disposal.

I completely understand if your normal light burned with your house.

Mine did too.

This is the first time in my life since 1984 I don't have an instrument to process my emotions with.

And I'm dealing with that, by using the what I have available to the best of my ability.

I'm asking you to do the same.

Because the question no one has asked (at least me) yet, is am I going to rebuild my life like for like, or am I going to reimagine who I can become and rebuild my life with upgrades.

Maybe take your time with your light to consider that.

As for my answer to that question, I'm reimagining my life--with the upgrades. And those upgrades are entirely dependent on the choices I make in moments like these when all feels lost at least once a day.

But for now, all I need to do is spend a little time with my light and just breathe.

The rest is in the future and my concentration is on the present.

The fires in California have only intensified since then. I‚Äôve spoken with quite a few people this month for have been impacted by the wildfires in LA. My heart goes out to you. If you have lost your home or not, there are so many symptoms related to wildfires and natural disasters that make it difficult to continue with ‚Äúlife as normal‚Äù. It will never be the same ever again and that grief is REAL. 

Right now we are a community in shock. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, as a survivor and therapist who has come out the other side I would recommend you get in community (even if you don‚Äôt always feel like it). Grief is not meant to be experienced alone. 

Need more support? Seek out a mental health therapist with experience in trauma. 

If you are a mental health therapist who is available feel free to comment a little about yourself below. Let‚Äôs connect and remind each other the struggle is real but we aren‚Äôt alone.

Thank you all who donated to my Pasadena Humane Society and who have donated to the victims of the fires in LA. 

I also want to show my appreciation for all the firefighters and police officers who put their lives on the line to fight these fires and make sure our community is safe. The Eaton fire is only 95% contained, and the Palisades fire is 77% contained. It moved to the other side of the mountains and is no longer in our communities. We feel terrible for the animals that don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening. Please keep them in your prayers. We are supposed to have rain this Sunday. 

Thank you to @everything.doggo for creating this beautiful bandana. The profits went to the victims of the fires. 

Stay safe, friends, I hope to be back to regular programming‚Ä¶ somehow it feels wrong to post knowing the fires are still happening. Especially since the Eaton fire burned our favorite hiking place, burned homes in our city, injured lives, and took lives.

Sending a Big Hug
Hubble + Dog Mom

4469,eatonfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFOtU1jynxl/,213478624,Eagle Rock,"found this in the yard of my old place in Eagle Rock: a charred page from a book on 1940‚Äôs fashion. is it possible that it could have traveled the 7 or so miles from Altadena, and is a somber remnant of the Eaton Fire? it is quite plausible. 

the Eaton Fire started on the evening of Tuesday, January 7th. by the next morning, a significant part of the town of Altadena had been decimated. more homes, businesses and structures would be lost as the morning progressed. 

over at my place a few miles away, the sky was dark and orange with the smoke from the fire that had drifted over the area. it was dark at 7 am when i woke up - a strange realm between daytime and nighttime. the smoke cloud was massive and thick, like a colossal serpent slowly dragging its belly across the region, blocking out the sun as it soundlessly slithered overhead. 

i went out in my back yard and immersed myself in the uneasy stillness of that morning; an anxious silence of despair as an entire town not far away was being wiped from the map. and standing out there, something caught my eye: a snowflake gently falling, but one made of ash. and as i saw more ‚Äòsnowflakes‚Äô falling around me, i couldn‚Äôt help but notice the contradictory beauty of the strange, orange-hued scene. 

and then i saw the larger pieces of charred tree bark gently falling as well. one piece, about the size of this book page, landed delicately at my feet, like a dark gift from a malevolent fire spirit. i picked it up, held it in my hand, and took in the significance of the journey it made and what it represented. 

so while i am not one hundred percent certain this page came from the fire, my heart imagines a time when this book was in someone‚Äôs collection, sitting on a shelf in some modest Altadena living room, surrounded by other keepsakes and memories that made up this person‚Äôs home. artifacts that are forever gone. 

a friend suggested i frame this. perhaps: this scorched memento is currently in my living room.

Trump, newly sworn in this week as the nation‚Äôs 47th president, got a first-hand look at the staggering toll of the Palisades fire, which broke out on Jan. 7 amid extreme winds in the region. The visit did not include a trip, at least by ground, to see the devastation of the Eaton fire in Altadena and Pasadena or meet with residents there.

Yesterday I had the privilege of photographing Caroline and David, whose beautiful century old ‚ÄúJanes Cottage‚Äù was the sole survivor on a block of total devastation after the Eaton Fire tore its way through the community of Altadena, California. It was my first time in the neighborhood since flames consumed over 6000 homes on January 7th and 8th. How Caroline and David‚Äôs home was the only one to survive on their block will most likely remain a mystery, but a firefighter‚Äôs boot print can still be seen on the front door as he gained access to the house to make sure flames didn‚Äôt enter the attic. Three backyard trees were also cut down in an obvious battle that claimed the detached garage. It looks like Caroline‚Äôs beloved orange tree will survive. I was struck by the way the plastic pail used to collect the oranges was melted around them. Very little remains of neighbors‚Äô homes, but one had put out cat food and water in hopes that family pets had escaped the fire and are still in the neighborhood. Altadena is a beautiful community with so much rich, important history. I‚Äôm wishing them the best as they begin the journey to rebuild.

@artcenteredu and #altadena mean so damn much to us and our fam here at #corrovisvecomplexproject and it hurts to witness the devastations to so many friends lives from the #lawildfires 

We lost 30 homes of faculty members and dozens of homes/studios of students and alumni/creatives, it‚Äôa gonna be a long journey to recovery.
 When things get heavy and to much to bear, We witness, We step up, We help our brothers and sisters, Boots on the ground, then we Create Create Create in the studio!

We teamed up with @ecoresearchlab and got crazy in the corrosive complex studio 
And created this powerful Tee. This one is totally handcrafted with love 
Inspired by the orange dot we #handpainted an intense total eclipse, which represents a time of profound introspection, transformation and a deep reflection on a moment to reset, rethink and start fresh, then we freestyle screened the mantra for our #ecoresearchlab and #artcenteredu friends #ArtCenterStrong an acknowledging the city of our amigos. The front of the tee is simple and powerful with the iconic artcenter dot and the city we will rebuild
We used our staple hi quality permaset inks made in Australia for the hand painting and screenwork, which give the finish a soft vintage feel.

We wanted this to be for everybody so we used a hi quality 1301 tee that has a standard athletic fit, so if you want a full or oversized fit just size up, we made limited amount in all sizes.
We made two options on the front, the iconic orange dot, and a crescent dot version, which we feel represents movement, transition , let us know which one you like when you order
These are available in our #etsyshop or DM and we can hand deliver to you.

You don‚Äôt have to buy anything to help our amigos that lost everything, just donate.
But if you want our super sic  tee 100% of the price goes to artcenter faculty and fam that lost everything, not ‚Äúa portion of proceeds‚Äù we mean every penny of the sale goes to our fam

I am extremely fortunate that my home is ok. Have had a number of things to do and another big project that has demanded much of my attention, along with work and just the general stress of things has really prevented me from getting into an art headspace, but here we are. 

The world of scorn depicts industrialization of the very body itself, and therefore a reduction in meaning associated with the powers of the body. Here the ""queen"" of my chess set is modeled after clusters of artificial wombs. The once intimate and personal experience of pregnancy and childbirth has been reduced to a process step in a megafactory. The industrialization of the body in this way represents the loss of personhood, taking who we are and replacing it with nothing more than what we are constructed from and our functions. The self becomes a product and we enter a biological caste system where the form we are engineered with decides everything. 

The entirety of the world of scorn is one of a closed loop recycling system, where the only resource that remains is us. When we are the only thing left we are forced to consume our very selves in an endless loop, reducing every piece of our existence down to a system of basic parts to be reused and reformed.

There were only 9 days of filming left before we lost our sets, props, locations, and costumes in the fire. It's been a long road.

Our #LACountySearchDogs, K9 Clifford and K9 Prentiss, have been tirelessly searching through the devastation caused by the Palisades and Eaton Fires. Their determination and skill are instrumental as we continue working to locate those still missing amidst the wreckage.

The toll as of Jan. 25, 2025:

Eaton Fire: 17 confirmed fatalities, 18 still missing

Palisades Fire: 10 confirmed fatalities, 8 still missing

Our mission is clear: to bring closure to families and help our community begin to rebuild. Each bark, alert, and search is a step closer to that goal.

Thank you to everyone who has shown support for our teams. Your words of encouragement fuel them during these long days. Please continue to keep the impacted families, our first responders, and these resilient dogs in your thoughts.

4312,eatonfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFQ1hpjSK0L/,812348069,"Altadena, CA","21 days ago Tom and I were driving home, remarking how much we love our neighborhood. The beautiful trees. The old houses and within their walls every sort of family that called them home.

What we drove through this week was a wasteland. 

Couples standing in front of what remained of their lives, holding each other in silence. National guards standing around their hummers, assault rifles in hand. Utility employees and firefighters working hard to stabilize poles and cut down trees. Families in masks and hazmat suits, digging through rubble for just a piece of themselves. 

The second we got to our street, tears rolled down the sides of my respirator as I clutched my chest. My heart has been in pain every second since we evacuated. Nothing looked the same, I was disoriented‚Ä¶ Then I saw it. 

For the past 2 weeks it‚Äôs like my heart was working on a puzzle that my mind wouldn‚Äôt let me finish. When I saw the house, the final pieces snapped into place, revealing an image that was too much for my heart to bear. I collapsed to the ground, sobbing. I opened my eyes to find I was crying on a bed of ash, nails and shattered glass. Every inch of the streets were covered.

Our house was built in 1950. The first bathroom still had the original tub, vanity and pink tiles. The house was never ‚Äúflipped‚Äù, and it only had 2 prior owners. That‚Äôs the kind of place Altadena is. A community where people stay, grow and take care of each other. We were so lucky we got to call it home for even a little while. Thank you Altadena. 

Thank you every single person who has reached out, donated, sent clothing and groceries. I can‚Äôt imagine how helpless it would feel to watch this happen to people you love, but you should know that every bit of it is like an embrace and we will never forget it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π #eatonfire",2025-01-25 21:07:14+00:00

4278,altadena,eatonfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFRPOOUSTav/,812348069,"Altadena, CA","We lost our house in the Eaton Fire. Everything we had is gone. We are devastated and still in shock but working through it.

We spent four and a half years on construction, and it all went away in an hour. My wife Leila poured her heart and soul into this place. She was the designer and project manager for the whole thing and oversaw multiple subs and builders to create a beautiful forever home for us and a photography studio for her business. It truly was a magical place.

A good portion of Altadena is gone. Our daughter Stella‚Äôs school is reduced to rubble. We were so excited to find Altadena and make friends there and experience the close community. So many people in Altadena and the Palisades have lost everything and our hearts go out to them. 

Most of the things we lost were just stuff, not really a big deal ultimately. It‚Äôs the memories that are gone ‚Äì photos, videos, letters etc. ‚Äì that really get to me. I‚Äôll definitely be reaching out to friends to collect copies of photos from the past. 

This feels very odd to do, but we‚Äôve been encouraged and urged to accept the kind gesture of a friend to start a GoFundMe account on our family's behalf, to help with rebuilding our lives, when insurance money is covering only a portion of it. Here‚Äôs the link:

https://gofund.me/4d633f30 

I‚Äôm also posting it in my bio.

There is no expectation on our part, but please pass it on to others. For a lot of people, money is tight. The last 5 years have been insane to say the least. We appreciate the love and support from people who have been reaching out and if I‚Äôve learned anything from this so far, it‚Äôs that nothing is certain, and I need to try harder and connect more with my friends and family. They are the most important part of our lives.

Over 9,000 structures were destroyed, not including the thousands damaged. Tyler captured this photo the next day, Jan 8. 

Our home and water supply are both contaminated. We are currently unable to live there or feel safe using items from inside.

There had been warnings of high winds and planned power outages, but on the morning of the fire the winds started earlier than expected.

When the power went out that evening we were able to go off grid with our solar/battery system. The fire started to the east of us, and hit 10 acres by 7:15PM. The wind gusts had the potential to reach 100mph and they were going strong outside. As the fire spread it started burning houses. A neighbor was following LA Fire Dept. scanner reports to map out the houses that burned. We threw some of our belongings by the door just in case we needed to leave.

We later walked outside and could see the mountain side LIT up. I took the video of the palm tree swaying and it felt apocalyptic‚Äîlike something referenced in the show Extrapolations. We were expecting to go to sleep with Watch Duty app notifications on around midnight, knowing that evacuation warnings (and then orders) were being given to the east side of Altadena.

Oddly enough, Marina woke up around 3AM. I fed her a bottle and looked at my phone. There was a single burned house on the scanner map that was now on the west side of Altadena, not the east‚Ä¶ and just as I was about to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù our phones started blaring with the evacuation order alarm. We had never received a warning ‚Äî just suddenly an order to get out. 

I grabbed Marina‚Äôs first footprint and my brass rat box, then Roo‚Äôs leash because she hates smoke. We decided we would try to make it to Shawn and Danielle‚Äôs house, but we had no idea if there would be traffic or obstacles. We decided to leave a car and drive together. 

Once we made it to their place, now known as ‚Äúthe fortress,‚Äù we regrouped. Shortly after, Tyler drove back to our house around 5am. Thus began the journey of gas line shutoffs and hoses, knowing Marina was now farther from the flames #eatonfire #altadena",2025-01-26 03:21:04+00:00

We are in unprecedented territory as the burn zone has well surpassed the size of San Francisco. It‚Äôs important that we are all aware as a community that urban fires bring different challenges. It‚Äôs also important that we stay collected. We look to 9/11 and the Lahaina fires as examples of how smoke and ash exposure can lead to long term health consequences within the affected population. Think of all of the material in a home, on a car, in a business or old building. Those chemicals and components are now in the ash that we see collecting on surfaces in LA.

And while we have a human urge to return to normalcy so quickly, we should first ask ourselves if it is safe to do so.

Slide 5 contains current best practices that we know of so far. There are public webinars from @cleanairca. They have new insights on air quality, water safety and hazardous waste, with a panel of experts to answer your questions.

If you must go outside, use your best judgment and take the necessary preventative health measures currently available

A handful of metal tools that didn‚Äôt melt, but are really in rough shape, chips of ceramics.. literally nothing left and nothing whole. 

We drove through the neighborhood a bit for the first time. It‚Äôs really sad. It‚Äôs also wild seeing an occasional house that *seems* untouched and the citrus trees also seem untouched and baring fruit. Her neighbor already has fresh grass coming in, and we found a big and very active ant hill in her old carport.

4231,costcorotisseriechicken),eatonfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFRz8faRBVQ/,812348069,"Altadena, CA","Our first reunion ‚ù§Ô∏è Sesame was lost when the Eaton fire quickly engulfed Altadena, but she is a fighter, like so many cats, and was able to find a safe place until she could be with her family again. Sesame‚Äôs rescue couldn‚Äôt have happened without @wufaw_official and @del.gato.rescue who are so amazing to provide us with trail cameras. It is scary to set a trap without being able to monitor it. 

Here is how we‚Äôve been able to catch now 3 pets and 2 ferals from the burn zone. 

Step 1. ADDRESS. We need an address, kitties are staying on their properties from our experience so cross streets and general areas are not easy to work with. 

Step 2. FEED! Sesame already had a feeding station set up, so we added wet food and other distinguishing foods so when we returned the next day it would be obvious someone had dinner. 

Step 3. CAMERA. Now that we have proof that something or someone is eating food at this location, we can set up a trail camera to see who is eating. On our trail cameras we‚Äôve seen cats, crows, coyotes, raccoons, and skunks eating from feeding stations. 

Step 4. TRAP! Bingo, the camera shows that a cat is eating the food and no other outside friends, so now we can set up a trap. Dusk and night are the best times to catch a cat, so setting up a trap with really good bait (thank you #costcorotisseriechicken) at these times is ideal. 

Step 5. Wait. Be patient. Kitty might come and not go in the trap the first couple times you see them on camera; but most of the time, eventually they will go in either out of curiosity or hunger. AND sometimes you might catch a kitty you didn‚Äôt plan for, surprise cat! 

We‚Äôre tired. We work full time jobs and have our own cats at home. But we won‚Äôt stop trapping, these cats survived a fire, they deserve to be reunited with their family. 

Thank you to everyone who has supported us so far, for those of you who have been asking and wanting to help with supplies, my Venmo is linked on my link tree in my bio and so Amy‚Äôs in hers. Right now we‚Äôre estimating we‚Äôve spent around $200 buying a godforsaken amount of batteries and activating and running these trail cameras. Thank you.

‚ÄúMetro Fire is proud to announce that our regional OES Type 1 and Type 3 strike teams have returned home safely after 16 days on the front lines battling the devastating fires in Los Angeles County. These teams worked alongside agencies from across the state and beyond, protecting countless lives and properties in the face of the most challenging and dangerous conditions.

Our returning firefighters have shared stories of the incredible community support they encountered during their deployment. Meals prepared or donated by neighbors, signs of gratitude along roadways, and heartfelt words of encouragement from those they served. This outpouring of kindness reminded all of our fire family that they were not just fighting fires, but also protecting the hopes and futures of families across California.

To the families of our deployed personnel, thank you. Your support and sacrifice during these challenging weeks have made it possible for your loved ones to answer the call to serve. We are deeply grateful for your partnership in this mission. Metro Fire remains committed to serving our region and beyond, bringing hope and relief wherever it‚Äôs needed most.

4218,altadena,eatonfire,spanishsunday,firedamage,lafires,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFSwEqRp7Kw/,812348069,"Altadena, CA","It's Spanish Sunday and you may not want to scroll past the third or fourth photo here if you want to keep it happy. Just thought I should warn you‚Ä¶ 

I chanced upon this lovely Spanish style abode today when I went on a mission to see the truth of what has happened in Altadena with my own eyes.

 I don't recommend it, by the way. It feels extremely toxic, quite scary. And it's still not open to everyone. But as is evidenced by this feed, I document, especially when it comes to houses, so I needed to document this as well. And I have found through this experience that I should always follow my gut when it comes to that.

It's one thing to see one house in a neighborhood burned to the ground, that's upsetting enough.  It's quite another to see one house still standing when the others are all gone.  And it's much more shocking and chilling to see it in person than on the TV screen. 

You'll see here that I found this beautiful house, and across the street a wonderfully preserved vintage car, but just a few blocks away, things, the houses and cars, looked heartbreakingly different - almost as though there had been a cyclone or a hurricane, or tornado or even a tsunami! The destruction is so extreme‚Ä¶

And to be honest, I think I sort of went into shock. I noticed that I wasn't really feeling much of anything. It was like I instantly protected myself, turned off all emotion, because otherwise I would've completely fallen apart. 

I truly don't know how the homeowners are coping.

Yet I felt compelled to continue, to give you a real sense of it, from me, so you know it's as real as it can be, lest anyone doubt the media‚Ä¶ and because there's been some misinformation, not so much, I don't believe from the major media outlets, but from some smaller sources, and even unwittingly from me because of them. And I apologize again. But that's also why I wanted to go, because I needed to see the truth of it and understand the scope. The maps just aren't clear enough for me. 

So if you scroll, as you can see, the situation is as dire as it could possibly be.  And this is just such a tiny bit of the damage.

Please know that with so many looking and so little inventory, it can be challenging, but it is doable!! ‚ú®

From my experience these last 2 weeks, here are my tips: 

* Know exactly how your insurance company will handle your rental before you begin the process.

* Of course, use your Realtor but in this case ALSO use Zillow, Realtor.com, etc so that you have access to ALL rental inventory available. Those sites have more than we have access to.

* If jobs and school 
distance permit, be willing to also look to rent in cities away from the fire area, it can afford you more options, often for less $. 

* Once you find a place you like, submit right away! Especially, if you‚Äôre intent on renting in the area, you will likely be competing against others, so act quickly!

* Don‚Äôt set your sights on one home. You may have to apply for more than one before you find your home away from home. 

Sending my love and support to everyone affected by the fires. I have so many loved ones, family, friends, friends of friends & colleagues affected, I see/hear how overwhelming it is. I hope this helps! ‚ù§Ô∏è

What I'm sad about, but also most proud of is all of the things that we did together in our home. 

When it was time to tile the floors and walls, my mom was right there to teach me how to do it correctly. I‚Äôm so proud of my mom, she‚Äôs one of the most talented people you‚Äôll ever meet, and truly modest. 

We had found a bunch of bricks from the 1890s under the deck that I removed last year and decided to use them to make a pathway to the back yard. Ariane‚Äôs attention to detail made everything come together, and Theo did a great job sweeping sand into the cracks. It didn‚Äôt matter which of us was more skilled on a given day.. we did so much together. 

Inspired by Ariane‚Äôs dad, I also built a compost tumbler. Theo loved that machine. All of the soil in every garden bed was sifted to take out the rocks which we then used as ground cover around the fruit trees. 

I also included a picture of Theo using his butt to make sure that the countertops I made were properly glued in place. My mom‚Äôs friend gave me a whole day of his time to teach me how to fabricate corian countertops, and sent me home with all of the materials I needed. 

Gardening, cooking, and building are these last few pictures. This is what we do. Like I said before, the 'stuff' isn‚Äôt what made our home what it was‚Ä¶ It was all of the things that we did together, all of the daily patterns that we were forced to take a break from. I look forward to getting back to that life.

But never ever did losing my Community cross my Consciousness. 
That would be, and I am learning now, unfathomable. 
Most of us in the Collective felt this. And knew big changes were coming. All the signs pointing to 2025 welcoming massive shifts. 

I spent all of the Christmas Holiday having a major Detox. Which is what I call ‚Äúsickness‚Äù. I had multiple days of a high fever, could not eat for a week, could barely sip liquids. I wasn‚Äôt scared. I knew it was a purge. A die off. My family was off skiing having a great time which was wonderful. I could sleep and be alone in my home and heal. Everyday I kept saying to myself, I am so grateful to have this still and quiet time alone in my Home. I was taking it all in. I was very nostalgic. This was such a blessing. 

When my family returned, we did a beautiful deep clean. All of the closets looked and felt amazing. I had 4 bags of clothes to donate (they were in my car when we evacuated). That Sunday night we all discussed how amazing our Home felt. The best it ever had. 
Who knew that only two days later, it would all be released. 

Our Home was a Sanctuary for us. She loved and protected us well. 
Our neighbors looked out for us as we did for them. 
This Community gave us so much that will always live on in our Hearts. No matter what happens, if people rebuild and come back, or move on, Pacific Palisades will always be the most precious place and Community. A Village within a big city. A gem nestled in the Hills. 

I know that thousands of us are taking it hour by hour right now. As is right. Please allow whatever you feel to BE felt and seen. Let it all come and wash over you. And leave again. You do not have to have any answers now. You do not have to have your plan. You do not owe anyone a call back or explanation. Protect your peace. Dwell in the Silence to hear your answers when you can.
I love you.

Please attend and speak about how you have been affected by any of the wildfires that have ravaged OC and the rest of SoCal over the past decade at the Orange City Council meeting this Tuesday. Wear your No Orange Heights shirt, if you have one.

We know we‚Äôve been hearing the same repetitive reply from our city leaders, that everything is out of their hands and there‚Äôs nothing they can do any longer ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not true! The sad news of the recent wildfires jumping outside of wildlife corridors into neighborhoods, has strengthened our argument that developing anything at all in the Orange Heights open space is a terrible idea. 

The short sighted idea of building homes for a short term tax revenue gain will be met with untimely irony when multi millions (if not billions) are spent to mitigate a wildfire disaster. 

The whole area burned down in 2017 and with Southern Californians weather conditions getting progressively windier and drier every year, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it happens again ‚Ä¶ and as heartbreaking as it is to see animal homes destroyed - if the development continues - it would be peoples homes, lives, stories, futures, destroyed along with the homes of the animals.

The team had its first post Eaton Fire rescue call on Saturday. 01/25/25

The individual called for help while attempting to hike the Lower Sam Merrill Trail to Echo Mountain. After ascending a short distance from the trailhead, he discovered the trail was no longer there. 

Initial attempts by the hiker to retrace his steps down the mountain had him realize there was no clear path down. At that point, he called for help.

By the time team members arrived, he had been able to scramble down from his position. Team members drove him down to his vehicle, after a brief conversation with an agent from the U.S. Forest Service regarding the closure of the area.

The Eaton Fire not only decimated the town of Altadena, it also destroyed most of the trails in the mountains above. 

With very little vegetation or trees remaining, there is nothing left to hold back the earth. Most trails and roads have been severely damaged or destroyed, making them unsafe for use, by both the public and our team. 

Do not place yourself in unnecessary danger, do not enter the burn area in the mountains above Altadena and obey all posted closures.

2 weeks ago - we made a post wanting to provide free therapy to help, and today we‚Äôve connected families in need to hand-picked therapists from our network of 1,000+ licensed providers.

thanks to you, those families have seen our posts & yesterday was the first time we‚Äôve been at an event in LA since the fires started. @riselafest brought so many people together to support LA fire relief. shoutout @musicares 

being back in the world, seeing so many people call someone they love to check in & connecting with people who need help right now means everything.

I love what we do. I love the people we do it with. I love helping wherever we can.

it‚Äôs been a dark month, but we‚Äôre gonna get through this together + @callyourfam is here for you if you need someone to talk to.

Special thanks to @rossmorestudio for these fabulous sunnies, @dlashes for the chic leopard stole, @sloanbella for my gorgeous new boots, and @debbie.bean for my absolute favorite new trousers. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôå

As a fashion designer, one of the hardest things to accept after losing our home in the fires was realizing how much of my life‚Äôs passion disappeared with it. It wasn‚Äôt just about having clothes to wear‚Äîit was about the beautiful pieces I had been collecting for over 25 years, gone in an instant.

Fashion has always been more than just clothes to me‚Äîit‚Äôs self-expression, it‚Äôs art, it‚Äôs escape. It‚Äôs my story, stitched together through decades of memories.

In the midst of this loss, something extraordinary happened. Friends, strangers, acquaintances‚Äîpeople I never expected‚Äîreached out in the most incredible ways. Invitations to fashion gifting suites. Suitcases filled with designer clothes, shoes, bags, and jewelry showed up at the door. Gift certificates to my favorite stores. Vintage treasures sent with love.

It felt like a whirlwind of kindness and generosity flooded into my life. And through this outpouring of support, I was reminded of the joy fashion brings‚Äîthe thrill of putting on something beautiful, the comfort of feeling like yourself again. These gifts weren‚Äôt just about the clothes; they gave me a sense of normalcy, excitement, and a renewed spirit.

To every person, designer, and company who is helping outfit those of us who escaped these fires, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your generosity has given us more than just clothes on our backs‚Äîyou‚Äôve given us hope and the courage to dream again‚Ä¶ and most important, a sense of normalcy again ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is a painting I commissioned of our home called #KitCatCottage. The artist who painted it lives a few doors up from us. She's @lynnenora : Lynne Fearman. She and Ed lost their home in the Eaton fire. And all of her beautiful paintings burned in her studio as well. This painting is so precious to us, all the more so now!

Here's a response I sent to my @TravelStore clients who reached out to me with concern: 
""We evacuated January 7th a Tuesday. Sierra Madre -our village is part of the #EatonFire.
(FYI: this is my 5th fire since 1992 in this house) - we are just yards below the Mt Wilson trail -the national forest.

We arrived home 12th, Sunday -after 6 nights of evacuation. 
We have smoke damage, a scorched hillside back yard; lots of ash inside the house - but grateful that ours is still standing. Evidence shows that embers and hotspots were just a few feet from the house. #AFewFeetAway

Sadly, some of my TravelStore colleagues lost their homes, and many of my high school friends too. Devastating! We've been doing our best to help out.

I'm involved in our ""neighbourhood watch"" (75 homes) and have been ""What's apping"" - Kit and I have been busy as liase between our city officials to our neighbours: answering concerns about water, waste and mud cleanup. We're so sad for families in our town and all across LA county who have lost everything. Nerves were frayed again as winds picked up once more, we did not unpack in case of another evacuation.

As a Commissioner for the Sierra Madre Public Library I recommend that one checks their library's website for information. Because on January 7th, we evacuated with NO food, hotel had NO power, no stores were open. Thankfully our library had box lunches, power and wifi available on the 8th. 
~Once home on 1-15-25, we had a FLARE up - had to call 911 and the Elko, Nevada Fire Dept came up to douse a smoky patch behind our house. ( PTSD again)

THANKS to our brave canyon neighbours who saved our homes before responders arrived. THANK YOU first responders from all over the USA and the world for coming to our aid. 

We dodged a bullet! We pledged our support to help those who didn't.‚Äù",2025-01-27 05:28:32+00:00

A group of us worked on the trail to try and limit the mudslide damage that will be caused during the rainy season. We found one area that was still smoldering from the fire.  It‚Äôs going to take a lot of work over the next few months as the dirt was very loose in some areas and there were multiple areas that had some damage despite the work done by crews earlier in the week.  Hopefully, the work will help keep the slides from reaching the residential area below and keep the trails intact. #trailwork #eatonfire",2025-01-27 05:28:43+00:00

My heart feels heavy and the usual calming quiet of our beloved town, has now taken a much more somber and disheartening turn. Our city that my son grew up in, the streets we would drive on every day, are 90% destroyed and totally unrecognizable. Altadena, sadly, is gone. It‚Äôs going to take many years for things to go back to how they were. Unfortunately, my family and I will not be moving back to Altadena. There is nothing left there for us.

As I always say to do, I pulled down my window and Thanked them for their service..
The immediately waved with smiles and thanked me and I could genuinely feel the great sense of appreciation they had for me saying that. 
I ended up pulling over to chat with them, and found out they had all come down from Oregon to help with the fires. They dropped everything back home, their day to day, their families, all to come down here and help with this chaos. They had been here a week, and were here for at least another week.
As usual, nothing but kind and gentle souls and good humans. These are the faces of true heroes.. 
I felt truly grateful to be able to look each one of them in the eyes and shake their hands thanking them. 
And by the end, their deep gratitude and appreciation had made me a bit emotional as I really wasn‚Äôt the one who had done anything, and they were the ones that were doing Everything.

The center is staffed by a wide range of federal, state, and local officials, all of whom are able to provide general guidance and specific information about the recovery and rebuilding processes. We have found short lines (or no lines) and very helpful representatives of the various agencies.
Overall, the facility is a welcome and much-needed resource for us and our clients and neighbors who now need help. Please let us know if you have specific questions for us or any of the agencies involved. We would be happy to get back to you. Policies and practices are obviously still taking shape, but the overall picture (how everything will work in the various jurisdictions) seems to be clearing.  We have also been in touch with staff members who are receptive to email follow-ups and other continuing communication, especially for Malibu projects. Good luck out there!

Standing in the center of the catastrophe, it felt like being in a movie ‚Äì unreal, like a real-life nightmare. I was standing in the middle of N Lake Ave and the city was leveled, with only some bare bones of buildings, single-standing chimneys, everything scorched black and gray. Multiple fires were blazing on both sides of the street, there were people everywhere, firefighters and trucks all around and yet not enough to cover the amount of flames littered across the town.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The night of the fire we lost all power and our house gradually filled with smoke. Even though we were in the evacuation warning zone, the smoke was so thick that there was no sleep or rest that night. To be safe, I packed a bag with all my treasures and what I‚Äôd practically need. I looked at that one suitcase and saw how strangely my life fit into that bag and how easily I was able to say goodbye to everything else I owned.

My family and I, the house we live in ended up being safe, but incoming texts and calls would notify us one by one who just lost their house and which significant buildings were burnt down. Anxiety and worry and gloom accompanied the smoke in the air, and that was all only the first 24hrs.

The exhibition will include artwork pre- and post fires, interpretive and story telling wall texts by each artist, and a gallery talk with the artists on Saturday, February 22 at 2pm, moderated by Hannah Sloan in building F2 in Bergamot Station. 

The exhibition coincides with Frieze week. If you, or someone you know, is an artist severely and directly impacted by the fires, please share with us.

but sometimes seeing others do things that inspire you is the vitamin that will nourish your own efforts. 
This last week was all about continuing to support our community to recover and partnering with SoCal Gas to feed volunteers at The YMCA Foothill, who were running both a huge donation center and a beautiful space providing affected families a safe heaven for children to play while parents could either work or gather their goods. 
We feel very grateful to have been part of it, and of course, Arepas were filling tummies and hearts. People for a moment took the conversation towards food and culture and that also helped us heal. 
They loved this Avocado, Eggs & Cheese Arepa and we wanted to give you a little extra push to try it with 15% OFF until this Friday 31st. 
My hope for you this week is that you can also find something that fuels your purpose and inspires you. Oh! Also I wanna share a little background on how this happened‚Ä¶
It all started with a wonderful partnership that the Latino Restaurant Association and SoCal Gas did back in 2020 during the COVID pandemic to help bring joy to first responders by providing food to the fierce nurses and volunteers at Huntington Hospital among other places, and at the same time bringing business to small Latino restaurants like ours that were struggling and connecting us through food. 

That‚Äôs when I met Trisha Muse (pictured with me this last week) and Lilly Rocha who now during the fires have reactivated their team called Food Hug and called us to be part of it. How wonderful it is to continue being together during difficulties, can‚Äôt think of a better way to serve others. Abrazos

Not bad advice, but when my mood has no room for gratitude,  I do something no one recommends.

I count my hardships.

Which sounds counter-intuitive, but hear me out, because while there's great power in gratitude, we're emotional beings and there will always be times where we won't feel like being positive. . .

. . .and counting hardships is way to harness that negative energy in a constructive way.

This photo was taken this past weekend at the site of our burned down house.

It's a cherry tomato plant from the garden my wife and I planted during the pandemic -- a multi-year hardship.

There's a certain comfort that can be gained in reflecting on previous hard times that were weathered. It's a reminder that we have depths of personal strength and the aid of community to face unimaginable tragedies and come out on the other side feeling whole and loved.

So yes, there are other photos I'll share of the ruin of our home, but I felt it important that the first area of focus be of something that survived that horrible night.

Something that will always hold a place in my heart because when my wife and I planted that garden, it was part of our defense against the virus -- taking better care of our bodies to naturally build up our health.

It was also a bonding experience that strengthened our marriage in ways we couldn't have imagined.

And let's not lose sight that it's a sneaky path towards finding light when the dark makes all the best advice sound like silly platitudes meant for feeble-minded children.

So the next time someone tells you to count your blessings and you have to restrain yourself from telling them where they can put their advice, consider counting your hardships and remember that you've survived them all, even the ones that scared the hell out of you and left you feeling weak and alone.

In a highly controlled environment, residents were barred from re-entering their neighborhoods, creating tense scenes at military checkpoints. Evacuees, who had already left their homes, pleaded for permission to return in order to safeguard their properties. Meanwhile, those who remained within the evacuation zone faced the difficult dilemma of relying on family and friends to bring them essential supplies like food and medicine. Leaving the area, however, meant they would not be allowed to return without an LAPD escort, forcing them to choose between basic necessities and protecting their homes.

That‚Äôs where I was happiest‚Äîsandwiched between my workout and my cold plunge, sitting in the sauna where I got my best ideas. It was my sanctuary, my place of peace, within a home that‚Äôs now ashes. Somehow, the sauna was one of the only things that didn‚Äôt completely disintegrate in the fire. Here are the last remains, built to withstand over 250 degrees.

This month has been a world on fire for me. The day before the fires, I took my last sauna in my happy place. 200 degrees. That night, I discovered a devastating betrayal from someone I deeply cared about‚Äîan anger and heartbreak so intense it kept me awake all night.

The next morning, running on no sleep, I looked out my window, still adrenalized from the night before, and saw smoke rising over the hill. My world was literally on fire. A friend from Florida called, and through a mix of tears and laughter, I said, ‚ÄúMy entire world is literally burning down right now.‚Äù

The first 48 hours were some of the hardest of my life. The first wave of grief hit during that time, accepting an unforgivable level of betrayal and having to flee my house running on 24 hours without sleep. The second wave came when the fireman texted me photos of The Day House reduced to ashes.

Rage consumed me in those early hours, followed by hours of tears that felt like they could extinguish the flames. Tears for my home, for the life I‚Äôd built, for the betrayal I‚Äôd faced. But then, something shifted. After grieving so many losses at once, I began to look forward.

To everyone grieving the loss of their home, their sanctuary, or their world as they knew it: allow yourself to feel it all-the anger, the fire, the rage, the sadness, the emptiness‚Äîlet it out. The harder you release it, the sooner it‚Äôs over. Tears ran down my face for 5 hours, and then I was done. 

It became time to accept the present and start looking forward. To dream of new beginnings, new people, new places, and new joys. Sometimes, life has to burn everything down to clear the way for something radically new. It‚Äôs a chance to grow, to meet new faces, to see the world, and to build a new life‚Äîand the home‚Äîof your dreams.

Look at this stunningly-beautiful-in-every-possible-way book that was given to me by an immensely thoughtful family friend. Thank you @ridingstagram 

Mornings are my favorite time of day and since the fires they tend to begin at 4am. My kitchen table is not pretty these days. Not even messy with art supplies and that's the worst part. But look at this book! Read this prayer! It's everything right now as I prepare to go and do some important work at burn sites this morning. More to come. 

Also, it rained over the weekend. Thankfully just enough to dampen everything but not enough to cause mudslides. There is now snow on the mountains behind us. This place is wild. I've seen a couple of the local deer and our bobcat, but I wonder if the bears are ok.

(Part of the #AnthrotonikArcs series where we use the power of storytelling to aid us in our quest to reimagine what our lives can become after the wildfires.)

What I mean by this, is that the Inciting Incident of the #eatonfire and the #pacificpalisadesfire has only just happened.

At this point of the story, we've been thrust into a brand new world and because this level of existence is uncharted for us, we're going to:

1. Make mistakes
2. Miss cues
3. Try and bend this new world into the shape of the old world we're used to and we will fail at that.

But here's some things that can help you navigate this new path we've been set upon.

First, understand that you've entered this world with certain bits of information driving your approach to the problems you face.

The first type of information is insidious because it's a lie that previous traumas in your life has taught you about your capabilities and your place in the world.

In my case, I was immediately faced with one of my greatest fears, which is homelessness. Being abandoned around the age of five to live alone with a physically and emotionally violent father while my older brother and younger sister were taken by mother, was a brutal lesson in itself, but when I pleaded for my mom to bring me too and she said there wasn't room for me, had left me believing if I ever did become homeless, I would surely wind up in the streets.

But this was a lie taught to me by that trauma that I may have understood logically to be false, BUT WASN'T ABLE TO ACCEPT EMOTIONALLY as not being true. 

Read that again because it's important.

Now, my experience has proved this to be a lie, and I'm leveraging my emotional response to my stepmother immediately taking my wife and in to help me internalize that this core belief is false.

You too have a lie that's working against you from previous hardships that are giving you a fundamental limiting belief.

The problem is identifying it, but once you do, you can intentionally use this with the next bit of information I'll share in a future post to serve as a proverbial North Star to aid you in decision making.

Chris and Heidi have a very long road ahead of them, and I (Elisabeth) am just trying to strike while the iron's hot, so to speak. Thank you to everyone‚Äôs help so far! 

I'm reaching out on behalf of my amazing brother, Christopher Higgins, and his wife, Heidi. On January 8th, their home was tragically lost in the Eaton Fire in Pasadena.

In the early hours of that morning, Chris and Heidi evacuated with just the clothes on their backs, a duvet, and their cars. Later, they watched their home burn live on the news. It‚Äôs a devastating loss, especially as their neighbourhood was never considered fire-prone, and they hadn‚Äôt prepared a ‚ÄúGo Bag.‚Äù

Chris and Heidi have been a part of the Pasadena/Altadena community for 13 years. They‚Äôve lost their home and many meaningful possessions‚Äîirreplaceable photographs, Chris‚Äôs lifelong music collection, and much more. They‚Äôre currently staying with our parents and are safe, but rebuilding their lives will be a long road.

They are also working with their mortgage lender, FEMA, and their insurance company, which is quite overwhelming on top of everything else.

Both Chris and Heidi work for Jacob Maarse Florist, Chris as a delivery driver and Heidi as a designer. They live simply and humbly, but the immediate expenses‚Äîclothing, food, and securing housing‚Äîare overwhelming.

If you‚Äôre able to help, any donation‚Äîbig or small‚Äîwill go directly toward supporting their recovery. Together, we can help them move forward and rebuild the life they‚Äôve lovingly created.

Thank you so much for your kindness and support.

My wife held me as I cried for it and so much else that was lost.

The burning roof of the garage collapsed onto the car, crushing it from above. Then all that material burned away leaving the damaged shell of my beloved classic. The metal garage door lay across its hood covering its face like a funeral veil. 

The ‚ÄúSun Wagon‚Äù, as I called the Volvo, brought me so much joy with its yellow, bright disposition, and smiling grille that caused everyone to smile back at it. But the real happiness it gave was from the driver‚Äôs seat, shifting its mechanical gears and steering the large wheel with the view of the long hood guiding the ride.

3816,eatonfire,altadenastrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFYMdASyD1m/,812348069,"Altadena, CA","I nearly lost everything 3 weeks ago. My entire collection of oil paintings along with all the art I've personally collected through out my life. For some 30 hours I had no choice but to accept everything was gone. There was no reason to believe that I would be spared when 98% of my town was not. None of it felt real until my neighbor sent me a picture of my studio engulfed in flames. I evacuated the night before with just my dog and the clothes I was wearing, my computer and my journals. The second image in the slide is what my town looked like when I drove away, palm trees bending in 100mph winds, fallen trees and debris all over the streets and a massive red orb glowing behind me. I passed by all my neighbors who were packing up their cars, all those homes now gone. It was the most apocalyptic night of my life. There is an undeniable clarity that comes through when running for your life, a line in the sand separating what matters from all the things that weigh us down day to day that don't really matter so much. In the chaos of it all, I knew that if there was any chance of returning, and if my tiny wooden matchbox of a house survived, I would first rescue this painting- ""Saint Alok"" 24k gold and oil on panel- a piece that took nearly 2 years to complete and won top 50 in an international art prize a couple years ago, a piece I invested the last of my savings into the custom frame, even as I went completely broke and lost my art business- I still poured everything I had left into this masterpiece. And yet, for those days I had no choice but to surrender, even hope, which can be such a heartbreaking feeling. So I did, I let go. 
By some miracle, my paintings survived one of the worst climate disasters in California history. It's been a bit burdensome figuring out how to keep these pieces safe while I'm navigating houselessness for the second time in a year, it's also a great gift from the universe, one that I plan to do something meaningful with.

Black, Latine, Filipino, and Disabled community organizers have compiled large directories of GoFundMe campaigns accessible to the public.

The reason we‚Äôve seen so many chimneys survive is, of course, because they are made of bricks. So if they‚Äôre so fire resistant, why not build with bricks in CA, you might wonder? Earthquakes. Brick buildings are considered unreinforced masonry, which means they lack a skeleton and are held together by mortar, making them vulnerable to seismic activity. During an earthquake, mortar breaks down, causing the bricks to fall out and the roof to collapse. Before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, most buildings were brick and most of them were destroyed. CA restricted building with bricks in the 1930‚Äôs following the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. Los Angeles was one of the first cities in CA to require retrofitting of any unreinforced brick buildings.

At first glance they look like concrete, but if you zoom in, you‚Äôll notice that the standing walls of this house are made of bricks.

I‚Äôve been disappointed many times as a citizen of this country by both political parties. Having seen many disasters from afar, that to politicians, these calamities are just an opportunity for them to push their agendas. I don‚Äôt rely on them to fix my or my communities‚Äô problems but I do expect my local government to do their jobs as their decisions will shape what my beloved Altadena will look like in a year, 2 or 6 years. I don‚Äôt really want to even talk about politics because that‚Äôs the least of my concerns as a person who has to deal with this disaster. 

Between insurance claims, the devastations of loss and the aftermath, we are too busy as a community to simply get by and we don‚Äôt have room for hyperboles or debates. 

I wanted to give you all an update as to where we are today. It‚Äôs been over three weeks, and we still can‚Äôt find a semi permanent place to stay. Our insurance company has given us $0 for all the living expenses we‚Äôve incurred since and we‚Äôve stayed at hotels, friend‚Äôs couches and airbnb, having to load up our cars every week, uncertain of where we are going to stay next. We are grateful that our walls are still standing, but they are unlivable spaces covered in toxic smoke and ash. The smell is like burnt cigarettes and melted plastic. It gives me a headache going back even with a mask. 

I applied for 1 art grant yesterday through @cci_arts - ü§ûI‚Äôm hoping to try and find more as I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd be able to salvage from these damages. I am so worried that being without a studio will set me back so much. But I am also hopeful that once we find a place I can park for a bit and actually start to create again.",2025-01-28 19:08:13+00:00

and what I caught was depressing. 

There was a big spotlight on the Palisades fire but Altadena was a place I could nearly call home. In my high school days me and the old crew would sneak into the ‚ÄúEnchanted Forest‚Äù in the middle of the night to look for ghosts and Satan worshippers lol. too bad we didn‚Äôt find any but it was still a place I would  take hikes up to Echo Mountain.. and now its all gone.

What‚Äôs left of Altadena looks like a warzone.. and it still smells like one. Even if your house held up you‚Äôre still living in an area thats pretty much uninhabitable for years.

I find it weird how you can drive 15 min from Altadena and the world moves like nothing‚Äôs happened. Everyone‚Äôs on the next ‚Äúthing‚Äù while there‚Äôs people out here still picking up the pieces. The amount of virtue signaling around the fires has been insane. You have people outside of LA calling out people who live in LA for being silent about the fires in LAüòÇ

Like bruh. Most of us (myself and fam included) were packing our shit and getting ready to move in case we got the evac warning. If the winds picked up any longer that Wednesday night my fam‚Äôs home would‚Äôve went up in smoke too. 

If there‚Äôs anything that hasn‚Äôt changed through all that‚Äôs happened in Altadena its I still get stopped by the cops tho üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü´°üòÇ

Three weeks ago, the Palisades fire started and tore through entire communities here in West Los Angeles. I had never seen anything like this in my entire life. Nor had most people here in SoCal. Unfortunately, this was the perfect storm. It has been the driest winter on record since 1964, and this particular Santa Ana wind event was the strongest since 1997. 

Everyone on the Internet has someone to blame for this tragedy, and while I agree, people need to be held accountable, once this fire started at 11 AM on Tuesday there was no amount of water that could have stopped it.

I continue to pray for more precipitation to come quench the seared seeds holding memories of relations to LA‚Äôs cherished places in ashes. May the pollinators retrace their ways when the seedlings become blooms this spring and the lands get a chance to sing songs of what was so nothing is forgotten.

Look at Lahaina as an example of island tribes coming together as one lƒÅhui (nation) in a similar disaster. Through cross-pollination and benevolent intention, regeneration is gradual yet absolutely possible as a tight-knit species within sustainable subcultures.

In support of LA‚Äôs beekeeping community, I have been in touch with my friend @kasia.and.bees. Three days prior to the fires, she was in her La Crescenta apiary with a new student that lost everything. Ife Sangode-Olaitan (Pasadena native and holistic mental health therapist) and her daughter were living in a home built by her grandparents over 40 years ago until the Eaton Fire took it. To assist in fundraising efforts, Kasia and I are collaborating during these last days of Virtual Beelieve University‚Äôs open application window...

Apply for Cohort 5 of ‚ÄúIntro to Ethical Beekeeping‚Äù until 2/5/25 and $100 of your tuition will be donated to Ife and her daughter once you get accepted into the course. As a Cohort 5 student in the Los Angeles area, you will have the opportunity to purchase a nucleus colony of honey bees from Kasia when you receive a letter of acceptance from VBU.

These were the roads my mom and I would take to get to my elementary school. The houses were landmarks for me as a child. When I‚Äôd visit Sahag Mesrob as an adult I would intentionally take this route to revisit the nostalgia of my childhood drive to school. 

But now this neighborhood looked different. Home to countless firefighters roaming about and multiple firetrucks passing through. Ash, toxic fumes, and rubble was all there was when looking down certain roads.

One foot in the past, aching for what‚Äôs gone. The other moving forward, not because we‚Äôre ready, but because life insists.

The roads we once knew are closed, yet we still find our way. The walls that held our history are gone, yet we are still here.

Grief and resilience aren‚Äôt opposites‚Äîthey are intertwined. We grieve because we love. We rebuild because we must. And in this unfamiliar landscape, we are learning that home was never just a place‚Äîit was the people, the moments, the invisible threads that still hold us together.

This is the griefscape. The space between what was and what will be. And though we are forever changed, we are not lost.

We carry it all. And we go on.

A few months ago we styled an AirBNB for a dear friend, @daniellamonet. Once the project was complete, we found out that short term rentals are not allowed in that particular area of LA. Several months later, LA was hit with the tragic wildfires and this home that we poured so much thought and love into, sat untouched, yet fully furnished and fully stocked. The universe had a plan and made sure that this home wasn‚Äôt merely a weekly rental, but was ready for a family in need. Our hearts are full knowing that a family who lost everything in the fires now resides here. It all happened for a reason. ü§ç

Huge thank you to the people who added extra heart and life to this project: 

@janamariepetrosini for equally pouring her time, energy, and soul into this home. 

@helmandoar for the absolutely stunning artwork. The quality of your pieces are unmatched. 

@revival for inspiring the canvas with your uniquely patterned and insanely soft rugs.

@fablehome for providing top notch dinnerware and servware.

Last, but not least, thank you @roy3_visuals for always capturing our work in its best light!

The soothing, therapeutic lymph stimulation, gentle cleanse with nourishing clean products, nurturing touch, and attention to the belly where we store much emotion are greatly beneficial to regulating your nervous system and receiving intentional touch to help soothe your body and soul. 
The Reiki helps address the subtle/energetic body which suffers as well when we are impacted by trauma and catastrophic events. Acknowledging and soothing this subtle body also serves the physical, emotional and spiritual body.

Following the recent Palisades and Eaton fires, some landlords and businesses are illegally raising prices on rentals, hotels, and essentials‚Äîthis is called price gouging.

üî• What‚Äôs Happening?
With many displaced, demand for housing has surged, leading to rent hikes and inflated hotel rates.

‚öñÔ∏è Is This Legal?
No! In California, raising prices over 10% after a state of emergency is illegal and punishable by fines or criminal charges.

üí° Know Your Rights
If you spot price gouging, report it to the CA Attorney General or local authorities. No one should profit from a crisis.

However, I just want to rip the Band-Aid off right away and say that this is, heartbreakingly, one of my many favorite Altadena homes which was probably lost in the recent fire.

I normally save it for Valentine's Day, but I felt compelled to present it sooner. And this fits in perfectly with what I do on Wednesdays, posting unusual, artistic, wacky and weird homes or just utterly spectacular places. This counts as both. 

I would see the owner of this wonderful art project out there, working hard to keep the garden perfect. Imagine how many hours it took for him to decorate the house like this, and he would switch it up a bit for each holiday. 

I know I've said this before, but I'm going to say it again, this one hits very very hard. 

If anyone knows anything about this home or the owner, please connect me. I would like to express my condolences and see if there's anything I can do to help, and perhaps he would like these photos.

I'm not posting as frequently at the moment because I've come down with one of the many crazy viruses hitting our city. Please forgive me‚Ä¶

While I'm in bed, I'm going through all of my Altadena photos, trying to determine which houses are there and which are not. 

We have lost some historic landmarks, like the Zane Grey Estate and McNally Mansion, but just as important are the residential architecture losses, homes that may not have landmark status but that were still meaningful, homes that people took a lot of pride in, homes that people put a lot of effort into. And that's mainly what this feed is about, so I want to honor as many as I can.

Again, any additional 2025 calendar sales will go towards relief efforts, Link in bio.  And I have a lot of resources so if you or your friends need something, please let me know. 

Finally, I am gathering stories from homeowners, planning on photographing them either with or without the remainder of their homes, or providing them with the photos I have of their lost houses. Please keep that in mind, any connections would be greatly appreciated.

I‚Äôve been volunteering for over a year now, and let me tell you, there‚Äòs nothing quite like seeing someone get the help they need. Now, it‚Äôs my turn to give back in my own way.

‚ù£Ô∏èTo everyone who had to evacuate from Pasadena and Altadena‚ù£Ô∏èSo many people are thinking of you. I believe art can be a form of therapy, and I hope this helps in some way as you rebuild and return to normal life.

üíõ50% off tattoos for all evacuees. This offer is good through all of 2025, no limits, no rush. Whenever you‚Äòre ready, just hit me up and send your ideas to  madderlaratattoo@gmail.com

I have always been a proud, stand on my own two feet kind of person (well, with some help from mom and dad here and there). But, I‚Äôve always adulted well, compartmentalized well, and cared for others well. I‚Äôve been privileged in that I have never needed to rely on any sort of public or agency assistance. 

This has been humbling, exhausting, and enlightening. Disaster can truly happen to anyone. Feeling overwhelmed by all the systems can happen to even the most educated. Figuring out which box to check on all the forms can be confusing for even those of us who love filling out forms.

I have never felt so supported and assisted, yet overwhelmed and unprepared for this process. I watch people around me in awe, navigating this process with little to no English, difficulty reading, or any number of challenges. We are truly a community, relying on others to help us through. I met some of the most amazing people in line today. People I probably would not have met outside of this situation. I am privileged, but even the most privileged can be humbled in an instant. We are no better than anyone else. In one moment we are all placed in the same situation, relying on the same services and resources, and needing help from each other. For someone who is not a people person, I can, surprisingly, be great with connecting with people of all walks of life. Today was the day that came in handy. This is not the community I ever thought I‚Äôd be part of, but it‚Äôs one of the most supportive I‚Äôve ever seen.

St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church has been a gateway to Altadena since its dedication in 1927. Flames came within a block of the sanctuary.

A budding career in Pasadena allowed Neff to design a charming home in a Euclayptus grove for him and his wife in 1923. The house survived the fire, but its detached garage, as well as the house next door, burned down.

Attention outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, and nature lovers! 

Angeles National Forest Closures: Due to critical fire danger and ongoing recovery efforts from the #eatonfire, the Angeles National Forest, including parts of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, will be closed through at least December 31, 2025. 

 Affected Trailheads in Our Area:

‚Ä¢ Mount Lowe Trail
‚Ä¢ Mt. Wilson Trail
‚Ä¢ Gabrielino National Recreation Trail
‚Ä¢ San Gabriel Peak Trail
‚Ä¢ Bear Canyon Trail
‚Ä¢ Winter Creek (Lower & Upper) Trail
‚Ä¢ Ken Burton Trail

 Why This Matters:

‚Ä¢ Public Safety: These closures are in place to protect you from the hazards of fire-prone areas, ensuring that emergency services can respond efficiently if needed.
‚Ä¢ Resource Protection: The forest needs time to heal and recover from recent fires. Continued human activity can degrade the recovery process and increase the risk of new fires.
‚Ä¢ Emergency Access: Limiting access helps keep essential routes clear for firefighting and rescue operations, which could be critical in emergencies.

We urge everyone to respect these closures. Not only does this ensure your safety, but it also aids in the forest's natural rehabilitation. Plan your adventures elsewhere for now, and let's give our beautiful natural spaces the time they need to recover.
 
Stay safe and stay informed. For updates on when the forest might reopen, keep an eye on official forest service announcements and our updates. For the current closures, visit: 
 https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/angeles/alerts-notices/?aid=93079&fbclid=IwY2xjawIIgjBleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHf8rW674HgRtGXLFRMU2ZNMv1KEcVqUskaJj10zJ0m3ftgPF01ZnQudkdA_aem_xbNKRMB0ZPiyDfQy9xoxzA

3477,eatonfire,palisadesfire,rebuild,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFdTdXzv_B1/,212999109,"Los Angeles, California","‚ÄúRebuild‚Äù is a word that always unsettles me in the wake of catastrophic weather events and wildfires. It comes too soon, feeling reactive rather than making space for grief, fear, despair, and anxiety‚Äîemotions society is often so uncomfortable with. The urgency to set things right again takes priority, bypassing the depth of feeling that naturally follows such loss.

Questioning whether rebuilding makes sense in a climate crisis won‚Äôt stop the impulse to do it. But what if some far-flung outposts or deep canyons were left alone, so wildlife could reclaim them‚Äîfree from roads, mansions, and the resources required to build them? That radical thought is rarely brought to the table.

Just as judgments fly about how people did or didn‚Äôt care for their pets in the fires, harsh words were also directed at those with the privilege to navigate disaster with relative ease. Yet as I walked through the ashes of homes in the Pacific Palisades and the hills of Altadena‚Äîpast broken dinner plates and melted board game pieces‚ÄîI felt the echoes of lives lived there.

Family gatherings, growing children, music, prayers, the joy of pets welcoming their person home. Sitting on the stoop of a house that no longer stood, I realized: losing one‚Äôs home, no matter its size, must be terrifying. The strangeness of standing at a doorstep before its residents even knew their home‚Äôs fate was haunting. The remains of lives laid bare felt vulnerable and tender.

I thought of my own father, unwilling to leave his island home in a hurricane after my mother passed, because it was where he belonged. Maybe rebuilding isn‚Äôt just about walls and roofs. Maybe it‚Äôs about keeping the flame of hope alive‚Äîthat there will be a place to belong again, with loved ones and community. That isn‚Äôt reactive - it‚Äôs human.

If we rebuild in places prone to extreme conditions, we must do so with wisdom. Yet, before any physical rebuilding, there is an invisible one: the internal foundation laid at just the right time, in just the right place.‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

It‚Äôs been an uncertain time of concern for so many, and our kids are no exception.

Sending support to the teachers and administrators especially as they navigate this return to normalcy amongst a shared trauma that will no doubt take time to move through. I know the coming days and emotional impact will be heavy as we learn new stories and experiences of loss and a diminished student population.

Our collective support, volunteerism, donations, and outreach is still very much needed through the coming months. I will continue to share resources and give time in the ways I can.

Check out my wildfires page (in bio) for info on free mental health support services for kids and teens and how the nonprofit I serve, @composedgiving, can deliver essentials to those who need them (in just 3 weeks, we‚Äôve supported over 230 families ‚Äî and over half being in the Pasadena area).

If anything can be learned from the wildfires this year, it is that our community is resilient, compassionate, generous, and strong.

If you have questions, want to get involved with Composed Giving, or need support, you also can DM me and I‚Äôll put you in touch with who I know and what I have.

Sending love,

Go Bulldogs!

A full day of extreme wind, then many days of unstoppable fire.

Some people left their houses and possessions simply because the power went out from the winds before knowing a deadly fire would take their home. They expected to return to their houses as is, maybe a little messy from the winds, but not expecting to return to a leveled and scorched neighborhood.

Others left their houses within twenty minutes of hearing about the fast moving fire after being alerted to evacuate. People going door to door to tell their elderly or unknowing neighbors; some going outside to check on their wind-blasted backyards and surprised to see a fire moving towards them. The confirmation came with a citywide text to evacuate.

We Californians are used to the seasonal smell of smoke in the air from a brushfire nearby. But the time crunch and panic is wildly traumatic when you have to ask yourself in realtime the cliche question, ‚Äúwhat would you grab if your house caught on fire?‚Äù

Very grateful to all of the people I met who told me their stories, including homeowners, volunteers, first responders, and last but not least my cousin Milena for driving me around all week just after her mother lost her home in the Eaton Fire.

And TBH, we didn‚Äôt know.

So we reached out to Julia Van Soelen Kim, who is a Food Systems Advisor for the University of California. In 2017, she led the studies assessing backyard gardens after the Sonoma Complex Fires. She helped give us a bit of clarity + these 5 tips to follow when handling produce dusted by wildfire ash:

‚û°Ô∏è Protect yourself from smoke and protect your skin against ash. Wear an N95 mask outdoors and wear long pants & sleeves, gloves, hat and closed-toe shoes when harvesting.

‚û°Ô∏è Always wash your hands before and after harvesting and rinsing produce. If produce is completely covered in ash so no color is visible, discard it.

‚û°Ô∏è Gently pre-rinse your produce outside with a hose or bucket of potable water to remove visible soil and ash.

‚û°Ô∏è Before entering your home after gardening, remove your shoes and change into clean clothes. Bag smoky clothes and wash them as soon as possible to avoid tracking ash into and around your home.

‚û°Ô∏è Remove outer leaves. Rinse and rub produce under cool running water to remove soil, grit and ash. Wash your hands and peel produce before cooking or serving.

We lost all of our books in the fire. What better way to rebuild your library (or add to it) than to support his store in Pasadena. I had an autographed copy of this hardcover play The Debutante‚Äôs Ball. It is rare. So much so that Beth Henley herself was surprised to see it when she signed it for me. I hope to get it signed again some day. Special thanks to @carolemichele_creative for her kindness.

Unsurprisingly, it closes much of the front range for at least a year. This is certainly the correct thing to do in areas impacted by the fire, for both ecological reasons as well as public safety. However, I‚Äôm confused why several trails that are miles away from the burn activity are being closed (the Northwest corner of the map). Closing down Switzer Falls, Bear Canyon, the Gabrieleno, Ken Burton, etc seems unnecessary and heavy handed, given they‚Äôre in a totally different watershed disconnected from the region of the fire. You can check it out in detail at a CalTopo map I put together here: Eaton Fire Closure https://caltopo.com/m/C5G1V41

Either way, hopefully the land heals quickly. I‚Äôm already eager to get back out to the trails!

Renters are likely to feel the impacts, with soaring rental prices after the Lahaina, Maui wildfire in 2023 acting as a cautionary tale for LA.

Many LA renters are already struggling, and tenant advocates say more action is needed to prevent a potential wave of evictions in a city where housing is among the most unaffordable in the nation and more than 70,000 people are unhoused. 

Here is a round-up of the few measures leaders in the city and county of LA are taking to strengthen laws in favor of tenants, along with a few they have rejected or delayed. We've also included measures that tenants advocates are currently rallying around.

I am 99.9% certain that all of these lovely homes are safe, despite being right where the Eaton Fire hit.  It's pretty incredible‚Ä¶ Some of them were either next to or just across the street from many homes that perished.  Some of them seem to have lost their garages. But as far as I can tell, these are standing.

I'm not saying 100% because I've been wrong before, and even though I do my best now to check very carefully, sometimes it's not easy to tell from the maps. 

If you know otherwise, please let me know. 

I was just told number eight is gone. üòû

PS one of the main maps that I used to determine these things, the LA County recovery map, is no longer working. Does anyone know anything about that? I really loved that map and it really helped.

My looks from the 1st week in January! The rest of the month, I was running for my life, starring out the window, estate planning, and wondering if I have enough money for my sister and family to bury me properly. Like, how much would it cost to get my body from LA to Pennsylvania to get me in the ground with my Dad. I need better insurance. What insurance did my Dad have? Let me call my sister. Omg! All these fires and earthquakes here in LA!  I want my funeral in a real church; not a ""Christian Center"" I hope my family can get me in Calvary. 
Googles: Dead body shipping costs!

 I should eat today and bathe..Instead I slept til 4p almost daily. My God. The revenue loss! The people in #Altadena, the little baby ice skaters, must have been so cold! Omg will my Mom have social security. Hurricane Helene was brutal in her neck of the woods. I deserve this shot of whiskey. Oh, wait. Let me read the book Revelations again!

This was very healing for me to see how surreal the events were as they unfolded and some of the funny comments we made. If you were part of this tragedy, I encourage you to do this, but at your own pace, chunk it out and feel the feels as they come. Share your timeline with those around you so they can begin to understand how truly quickly this unfolded. I kept looking back and realizing wind was my only concern throughout the texts, even right up to the time we left. NEVER did I think the fire would hit us

The other important reason for doing this timeline is that trauma significantly impacts memory and if you plan to go through a process of healing with some sort of professional, this timeline can help aid you. It‚Äôs painful and exhausting, but in the end, I promise you- it is worth it

The Eaton fire that engulfed the city of Altadena as the Palisades Fire was raging dealt a catastrophic blow to historically Black neighborhoods, destroying over 7,000 structures and leaving at least 16 people dead. With redlining and other discriminatory practices making homeownership difficult to attain for Black families throughout American history, Altadena was a beacon for generational wealth building for those who faced restrictions due to their heritage. That makes the destruction even more tragic. 

For many of these families, the task to rebuild is insurmountable as everything they owned was in those homes that are now reduced to rubble. Insurance companies have dropped fire coverage for over 100,000 LA homeowners, including many living in Altadena. Despite a moratorium requiring the insurance companies that recently dropped fire coverage to pay out for those homes affected, the fight to rebuild and maintain coverage in a world where these horrific blazes are becoming more common, is only beginning.

The one who needs help. The one who doesn‚Äôt have it all together. The one who has to say yes instead of I‚Äôve got it. And I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.

We build our identities around strength, around being the one others can count on. But when life shifts‚Äîwhen we‚Äôre the ones who need support‚Äîit feels disorienting, even wrong. The instinct is to resist. To prove we‚Äôre still capable. But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm learning:

Accepting help isn‚Äôt a loss of strength. It‚Äôs an expansion of it. True resilience isn‚Äôt about standing alone‚Äîit‚Äôs about knowing when to lean.

So if this feels hard for you, too, I see you. And maybe the real work isn‚Äôt in holding it all together‚Äîbut in learning that we don‚Äôt have to.

After losing everything in the fires‚Äîmy home, my belongings, even the feeling of being grounded in my own city as an evacuee‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm truly back at the drawing board. Not just rebuilding a house, but redesigning every piece of my life from the ground up.

Thousands of people in Los Angeles are facing this same reality. It‚Äôs overwhelming, but the only way forward is to take it one step, one decision‚Äîone pencil‚Äîat a time.

If you‚Äôve lost everything, remember: you don‚Äôt have to redraw your entire life in one day. Pick up one pencil, make one mark, and trust that piece by piece, line by line, a new masterpiece is waiting to unfold.

My friend Alex and I decided to go out and meet some families who we felt could really use some help in getting their story out there and raising more money for them to be able to get through this unprecedented time. We‚Äôre going to be sharing these videos around as much as we can, with a link to their GoFundMe page. 
Right now, the goal is to raise money so that these displaced families can cover things like rent & essential every day items, while they slowly work on rebuilding their homes. Eventually, the goal will be to replace some more specific items like computers, cookware, furniture, etc. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a family directly and has the means to give substantial amounts, please reach out to us so we can talk.

Even before the fires, Amaya and her parents, who worked in film, were in a vulnerable housing situation due to the Hollywood production strikes. Amaya and her family moved ten times in the last two and a half years before finally settling in Altadena, where they found a community to be a part of and love.  Donating to this GoFundMe will help Amaya continue to attend school in person for the rest of her Sophomore year and find a home for her and her family to stay. 

So far Amaya has raised less than 25% of her goal. Go to https://tinyurl.com/art-aid-2-gfm to help her reach it!

Thank you to @_jenmelchor , @guesssiu , and @noahklabin for volunteering with me at @pasadenajobcenter this past week. 

Friends and Family, what happened in Altadena is tragic. It‚Äôs one thing to watch it passively through our phones or TVs. It‚Äôs another to see it in person. To smell burnt structures, hear the clatter of circling helicopters, and see the heartbreak of those who lost everything. 

While processing the destruction of an entire community has been hard, volunteering and seeing Los Angeles show up and support Altadena has been amazing. If you‚Äôre looking to volunteer I highly suggest swinging by @pasadenajobcenter. If you‚Äôre looking to donate @outwardboundadventures and @altadenamountainrescue are doing fantastic work within the community. 

I took several photographs documenting my old neighborhood. I‚Äôll develop and post those over the next couple of weeks. Thank you to @lumentation for providing me film for my trip.

Recovery should not mean displacement. It should mean families returning, neighbors staying together, and communities rebuilding stronger than before.

ARC is a volunteer-led movement of architects, designers, and builders working on real solutions. Fireproof homes. Resilient neighborhoods. A recovery that makes sense for the people who live here.

If you believe in rebuilding better, in making sure no one has to start over somewhere else, in a future where wildfires do not mean losing everything, then join us. Let‚Äôs get to work.

A huge thank you to @oltreehui @morganvicki @joannandrews @attaboycowboy @ccamarena for the branding design and support. Your work is shaping this movement.

Trying to keep the apples safe from squirrels; didn‚Äôt really keep it safe from the fire. 
The number one thing I can recommend is to get a public adjuster! 
After I lost my house in the Woolsey fire, I tried to just deal with my insurance. Keep in mind, I was 3 months pregnant with a two year old. My insurance agent suggested that while we wait for our cleanup and rebuild - I should buy a trailer and live next to all the toxic chemicals and ash of my burned down house and my neighbors burned down houses. With my dog, cats, my two year old, and very pregnant belly. 
Get a public adjuster! They will fight for you to get what you deserve. Your insurance representative fights for your insurance company, not you. I know it‚Äôs overwhelmed. This will help make it manageable.

The communal pain, loss, and devastation is unfathomable and yet the love, kindness, generosity, and community organizing has been astronomical üí´ We truly are love in the midst of all the chaos around us. The first photo was taken 2 hours before the Eaton fire broke out. My anxiety was so strong I thought I was going to have a panic attack so I went out foraging all the beautiful branches that were falling down everywhere. I had no idea how bad it was about to get. I won‚Äôt post any fire pics. I won‚Äôt post Lake burning down, or all of our favorite local spots, or the beautiful burnt down homes of all of our friends and neighbors. I‚Äôve seen enough for a lifetime. What I will leave here is just a tiny sliver of how I‚Äôve experienced the last 3 weeks. I wish I would have gotten more photos of the 100‚Äôs+ people that have come through our doors that we‚Äôve hugged, cried with, and held. It has been an honor of a lifetime to be able to give folks high quality sustainable clothing to begin to rebuild their wardrobes. We couldn‚Äôt have done it for this long or served this many people without the help of friends. Thank you @ladywhite_co @firstriteclothing @claggie @cecilia.cecil and @persephonevint for your incredibly generous donations. Thank you @thisrepairshop and @dadgenre for your help getting this started and of course thank you @callmecesco for being my partner and supporting in every which way all the time ü§ç The last slide just hit home hard when I read it today, written by a woman who lost everything.

Over 9000 structures destroyed in 12 hours of high winds on January 7th and 8th. This unprecedented destructive event occurred at the same time as other major fires around LA, including the 23k acre Palisades Fire that destroyed over 6000 structures. The Eaton Fire eventually burned over 14k acres into Angeles National Forest. Wildland urban interface and many more diversely populated neighborhoods are completely altered, whole blocks in ruins. After weeks of valiant efforts from fire fighters, including inmates, along with much needed rain these apocalyptic fires are fully contained. 29 people lost their lives, with more missing. Sadly as the rumble is gone thru, the death count rises.

Altadena's Balian Mansion - SAVED!

In Altadena, the name Balian is synonymous with Ice Cream, and apparently it was quite delicious.  Like the Helms trucks of my childhood, delivering baked goods to the neighborhood, the Balian trucks delivered ice cream throughout the area‚Äôs schools and grocery stores, and the success led to the purchase of this house, The Balian Mansion, famous for the most outrageously brilliant, bright and magnificent christmas display, featuring over 10,000 lights.

George Balian‚Äôs father purchased the magnificent mediterranean mansion (built in 1922) during the mid 1950‚Äôs. By 1955, the elaborate  displays started to appear.  From mid-September each year, the lights would start going up, to be ready by December, and stay up through the year‚Äôs end.  In later years, though they wouldn‚Äôt always be lit, the lights would just stay up.

Viewing the light show became a tradition for generations of families in the area and beyond, and along with Christmas Tree Lane, and St. Albans Road in San Marino, there was always lots of Christmas fun to be had in the area.

This ‚ÄúHouse of 10,000 lights‚Äù was also a popular film and TV location, starting as early as the 1920‚Äôs when they used it for filming the silent ‚ÄúSeven Years Bad Luck.‚Äù She also appeared in Knots Landing, Ratched and Palm Royale.

Sadly, the lights were turned off for good in 2010, and George died in 2019.  Later that year, there was an estate sale, liquidating old Balian signage, chistmas decorations, and other items associated with the legendary abode, including 6-foot-tall crystal chandeliers and other momentos of the luxurious life the inhabitants had once known.

The house and joy that it brought to kids young and old for decades will never be forgotten. Rumor has it that relatives of George, who now own the home, are trying to decide what to do with it.  The proceeds of the estate sale were intended for its restoration. I certainly hope they will do their best to ensure it is preserved. Thankfully, it escaped the fire! Does anyone know anything else about it?  Please let us know!",2025-02-01 04:51:59+00:00

These photos and my experience taking them, walking on these demolished streets, is for anyone who feels grief after what happened.

Others, like me, are hurt from the fact that this beautiful, familiar area that *is* home, has been so brutally changed and knowing that so many are struggling to rebuild their lives and homes. But - there‚Äôs also so much love, strength, and community bond that‚Äôs happening. And I‚Äôll say again what so many have said already.

Los Angeles Fires
January 2025

We met with leaders from Eaton Fire and toured the Palisades Fire and parts of Eaton. These fires are sisters, not twins, and will require specific care for each.

We met with California State Senator Ben Allen + staff and the District Director of Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin to answer questions, listen to concerns, and plan delegations.

We next spent a couple of amazing hours with the clergy of Kehillat Israel Synagogue, the same wonderful folks who hosted us for a webinar last week and included other faith-based communities. Faith communities play a critical role in communities post-disaster. 

When the houses are gone, having a circle of humans encompassing and sharing your collective grief and providing solace is a guiding force for recovery. 

We spoke a long time together. It was very moving and full of humanity and tears. This is a club no one chooses, but is full of the best of humanity. 

We treat every event with the respect and care it needs and deserves.

We are grateful to be included in the #FireAidLA event and sat with fire survivors and Team Rubicon. 

Many thanks to the team at SnapChat for taking amazing care of us throughout. ‚ù§Ô∏è

It was a wonderful way for the benefit to raise money for the families who lost everything. One thing about this city is how so many people rally to help each other. 
So many legendary performances and collaborations that blew my mind. From Greenday and Billie Eilish performing Last night on Earth, Anderson.Paak bringing out Sheila E. To drum solo, and then he brought out Dr. Dre to sing Still D.R.E and then California Love. Another amazing moment was when The Black Crowes brought out Slash to perform Going to California.¬† 
Then Joni Mitchell graced us with her voice. Steven Stills and Graham Nash sang Teach your children well.
But my favorites were No doubt, Stevie Nicks, Pink¬† and the Nirvana reunion. Listening to Stevie Nicks perform Landslide as a tribute to the fire fighters had me in tears. And Pink's acoustic set was amazing! And my all time Fav No Doubt's energy was contagious! And the Nirvana performance of All apologies with Violet singing while her dad played drums was perfection. This entire night was so iconic LA and one I will not soon forget!!

This is one of those sad ones... 

In my neighborhood explorations, there are certain houses that just stand out to me, certain ones that touch my heart deeply. This was one of those houses, and I'm very sad to say that it's another casualty of the Eaton fire.
 
When I heard this news, I was devastated. 

It's one thing to admire a house from afar, or from the sidewalk, it's quite another to actually meet and talk to the homeowner, learn a bit more about the home, and express my appreciation for it. All of that happened with this house. 

In fact, I first saw it when I would be driving by, without time to stop. But eventually, I pulled over, and ended up doing so several times.

It was the last time, back in October, when I visited the Zorthian Ranch, also lost to the fire, that I not only stopped, but I spent a little more time and lucky for me, the homeowner came out! 

Brian couldn't have been more friendly, and told me all about their resident monster Wolfie, how they used to just bring him out for Halloween, but ended up leaving him year 'round for all occasions, dressing him up for each one. I'm pretty sure I have him as Santa as well, but couldn't seem to find that today. If I do, I'll put it in stories. But he's dressed for Halloween, for Fourth of July‚Ä¶ He became a welcome symbol of this lovely 1927 Dutch colonial abode and the family living here. Please see that 10/19/24 post. 

If the family is reading this, please know how much my heart is with you and how sad and sorry I am. I know you took pride in your home, and you brought so much joy to those of us who had the pleasure of seeing it every year and for every holiday. 

Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

We land on this sabbat that venerates fire and water just as there are finally no active fires in the region. As of last night, the final night of this very long experience of January‚Ä¶No more active fires in Los Angeles. (I needed to type it again just to read it again, to try to take it in.) I feel mournful relief. 

Needless to say, I do not feel called to light a candle or anything that burns in honor of this midway point between the winter solstice and vernal equinox. But I‚Äôm taking a moment to think about the Celtic celebration of this time, and how it marks the beginning of healing, of moving out of darkness, toward the light.

Moving forward is going to look so different for each person who has lived through this time here. It‚Äôs going to look different across the country as we begin to deal with the very real and dangerous repercussions of that person being sworn in on the 20th. 
There is so much work involved in moving forward in any way, and I just want to remind you, in case you need it, that there is room for your hope and your sorrow in the same moment. They are not at odds with one another - they honor your existence and experience in this world.

I have been blessed with the most amazing friends as you can see from previous posts. They know me inside and out, with all my neuroses and the good parts too (I got jokes and can bake). 

But these two- they‚Äôre my saviors during this crazy time. I don‚Äôt do well with change, I get anxious, grumpy and depressed. I avoid change at all costs and when change is forced on me, I freeze. Niki (@scubaxtravel ) and Rusty (@rusty.berry.ssa ) saved me from going out of my mind trying to figure out a place to live and manage all the other things that have taken over my mental and emotional energy. I see other fire refugees bouncing from place to place, living in hotels, on couches, in shelters, relying on insurance and assistance to get them through. I know I‚Äôm strong, but I really think this would have shattered me. These two made me a cozy place in their home. They‚Äôve made me feel welcome and like it‚Äôs my home too. Rusty makes delicious lattes in the morning, Niki cooks delicious meals and keeps my shopping in line and gives me chores and makes me laugh and literally occupies my brain with tasks- which I absolutely appreciate. AND THEY HAVE CHICKEN‚ÄôS Y‚ÄôALL- WE‚ÄôVE GOT EGGS!

This woman (I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs going to kill me for the pic I chose) is one of the most giving, generous people I know. Karen (@superjoose ) was my partner in crime when I worked at the high school, continues to be one of my besties in and out of work. We‚Äôve got the same humor and share some good grumpy times. When I first learned my home burned down and started panicking, I reached out for support because I was at a loss of how I was going to be able to move forward. My first panic was holy sh*t, I have NOTHING! (Now mind you, I am privileged in that I have a great job that supports me, but the thought of rebuilding my life was more than I could handle). This magical woman recognized that my typically well functioning brain was not braining and jumped in without being asked to set up a GoFundMe. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I cried when she did that and you all jumped on board to make rebuilding just a little bit easier.

I was in California last week and spent a short time looking at the devastation. With no power, there was silence; except for the power crews on every street working to string new lines to get some energy back to the area.

I had debated whether to post the few shots I took (and if any of these are your property and you prefer they not be here, please, please let me know). Then my friend and fabulous artist, @stephanieclairfineart, posted a new painting yesterday symbolizing a rebirth, a growing, and the strength from within, and I think the hope and prayers we all have for those that suffered in this catastrophe. 

I thought I would share; to document and grieve with those that lost, and look toward the rebirth....

As PCH reopens to the general public this morning, I hope people remember that thousands of residents here are mourning the loss of their homes and neighborhoods. Please be respectful when driving through Malibu. Yesterday I saw a couple sobbing in the middle of an empty lot and another elderly man just leaning against his car, staring at what used to be his home. Locals were only allowed back a couple of days ago and are still processing the loss. 

I‚Äôm happy that the local businesses we know and love will get a much needed boost from the opening. I understand how crucial this is to the healing journey for everyone. Hoping this can coincide with keeping everyone who lives here safe, secure, and with a sense of dignity while grieving their losses and beginning the long road back to rebuilding or repairing their homes and lives.

For myself and surrounding friends - plant, animal, land and human - this Dragon/ Snake transition has been defined by stormy, fiery destruction. Our skin has been forcibly shed in an epic and traumatic manner. 

Neighboring hills are lonely, raw and bare, nearly devoid of their plant and animal companions.*
Scraped clean by Fire. 
The feeling echoes inside. 
And yet, I can feel the land breathing.

Wood nourishes Fire. Fire nourishes Earth.
The nature of Nature and the Elements is unapologetic. They simply Do as they Are. 

This can be tragically destructive for humans, resulting in toxic rubble for All, ashen memories, and exceptional grief to navigate amidst massive overwhelm.

We have been shocked into a state of transformation and renewal, as Snake represents.

Learn from Snake. Spending much time in stillness, it deeply senses and waits before acting. Curl into your Self and listen. To your Nature, the Land and Sky. Protect your tender, freshly exposed skin, allowing space for both loss and change as new layers reveal. 

Much love to all in Altadena, the Palisades and throughout Los Angeles as we navigate this complex process of loss, and growth, supporting others as best we can.

Please consider donating to those most vulnerable in the Altadena community who have been displaced. Links in bio. 
Thank You.

*While cradled by hills scorched from #EatonFire, our home and most nearby were spared. Grateful for our luck, I am viscerally gutted for the many friends - plant, animal and human - who suffer so very much.
This comes from that cleaving mix of emotions, hope garnered from traditional knowledge and ancient wisdom, and relationship with the surrounding nature, now charred, that I have been communing with for over a decade.

She eventually landed in California and was able to buy the house we would call home in Altadena 37 years ago. It was a feat; my mom as a single mother worked multiple jobs throughout the years and we hopped around Altadena, Pasadena and wherever else we needed to in order to keep our home. I‚Äôm blessed and privileged, thanks to my mother, to have been able to have a roof over our heads that housed many dreams, many experiences, many gatherings‚Ä¶it housed many people who needed a place to stay to get on their feet.

I used to say I‚Äôm from Altadena and no one would know where it was so I would just say Pasadena or LA. I never knew how describe this place economically and culturally - the fact that we‚Äôre Black of varying classes, riding horses and having chickens (well at least we did for a while) living at the base of a mountain. I didn‚Äôt think the world would know about Altadena in this way but it‚Äôs been beautiful to share in the magic of it with others who know it intimately.

I know so many people impacted and we‚Äôre really just getting over the shock and now into the years-long reality of what it means to come back from this. Yall came through - I appreciate every call, text, email, donation. The amount of love me and my family has received inspires hope.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) has begun air monitoring efforts in the burn scars and surrounding communities of the Eaton Fire and Palisades Fire. This initiative, in collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), aims to assess air quality during debris removal and cleanup.

üî• Why is this important?
Debris removal can cause hazardous dust and ash to become airborne, potentially affecting air quality and public health.

üî¨ Monitoring will occur in two key stages:

üìç Stage One: Mobile Air Monitoring (4 weeks)
üöõ Two mobile units will measure toxic metals & volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
üìå Identify potential hot spots near the burn zones
üîç Help determine locations for temporary air monitoring stations

üìç Stage Two: Stationary Air Monitoring
üì° Air monitoring stations will track particulate matter (PM), lead, arsenic, and asbestos
üè° Placement will be based on mobile monitoring data, cleanup activity, and proximity to homes & schools
ü§ù Ongoing coordination with federal, state, and local agencies

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminder:
Residents should not attempt to clean up fire debris (burned structures, vehicles, furniture, etc.). The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LADPH) and Pasadena Public Health Department (PPHD) have prohibited unsafe removal of fire debris to protect public health.

This is his story.

üë®‚Äçüöí Chien Yu has been a firefighter with the Pasadena Fire Department for 18 years. His family lived in Altadena, where they built a life together‚Äîuntil the night of the Eaton Fire changed everything.

üå≤ ""I saw the glow through the trees. Kim and I got our kids out when we got orders to evacuate. After they were safe, I went to work. We fought the flames for sixteen hours, but the winds were unlike anything we had ever seen. When we finally got a break, I checked on my house‚Ä¶ it was gone.""

üíç A few days later, as Chien sifted through the ashes, he found something he never expected to see again‚Äîhis wedding ring. He always took it off for work, never thinking it would survive the fire. But there it was, a symbol of love and resilience among the ruins.

üî• Despite everything, Chien keeps showing up, giving back, and pushing forward. When he saw his portrait for the first time, he said he was ""REAL CHEESIN!"" üòÅ That's the spirit of a true Guardian.

If you'd like to support Chien and his family as they rebuild, please visit his GoFundMe page (link in bio). 

Every bit helps. üôè

üî• Nominate a firefighter to be featured in this project! Drop their name in the comments or DM me their story. Let's make sure their sacrifices are never forgotten.

üî• Proceeds from this book will go directly to a fund supporting firefighters‚Äîthe specific fund will be chosen with input from the firefighters themselves to ensure it has the most significant impact.

For me I was constantly thinking of the people who lived there, the intense graphic image was someone's home not just subject matter for my camera frame.

As of January 31st, the Eaton fire has been contained and we are so grateful to all of the first responders who fought for 24 grueling days. What remains is the unimaginable rubble left in its wake. 

My friend Maddie‚Äôs home was completely destroyed along with everything in it. She was able to evacuate having only a few minutes to get out safely with her dear pup, Benny. She‚Äôs now facing the overwhelming task of starting over. 

For me, Maddie‚Äôs home was more than just a place‚Äîit was one of the first spaces that truly made Pasadena feel like home. It‚Äôs where countless friends and groups gathered, where community grew, and where so many meaningful moments were shared (inflatable obstacle course included). Now, she and her sweet pup are displaced with no clear timeline for recovery. 

If you‚Äôve ever been without a place that made you feel safe, welcomed, and cared for, you know how much it means to find that hospitality. If you‚Äôve ever had a person that embodies the feeling of that place, then you get the gist of how much Maddie means to all of us. I‚Äôm asking for your help to give that feeling of unreasonable hospitality back to this incredible woman and ray of sunshine. Even in the midst of so much chaos and paperwork, Maddie is still finding ways to look out for other survivors and take care of her beloved Altadena. 

Even a small donation to her GoFundMe can make a huge difference in helping her get back on her feet. Please don‚Äôt underestimate the impact any amount can make! If you‚Äôre unable to donate financially, sharing this post, a gift of yours, or keeping her in your prayers means just as much. 

Link is in our bio‚Äôs üíõ Thank you one and all for your love, kindness, and generosity.

The needles were burned off and other parts were singed, and it almost looks like ash and debris embedded in the damaged part of the plant‚Äôs exterior. If that was the case it memorializes the power of the fire storm. I could definitely see ash had blown up into the plant. I am going to have to research it more to find out more about this cactus to understand the damage, it just seems there is a lot of scientific information here.

On January 7th, the Eaton Fire roared down the mountain while the family was watching Wicked in the local theater. They never made it back to the house and unfortunately were unable to salvage anything including their beloved hamster. Aimee invited me to photograph the family with the remains of their home as they looked for anything meaningful. It was a privilege to document this important moment in their journey yesterday.

Every hotel we‚Äôve been to has been booked with displaced families from the fires, mostly Altadena. Like us, many families evacuated in two cars. So now the hotels have to accommodate for more cars per room than they are used to, and the parking lots get full fast. 

Furthermore, there are insurance adjusters, relief organizations, utility workers, etc. from out of state staying at hotels. Many will have their own rental vehicle. The other night, I couldn‚Äôt find parking at all when I was in my wife‚Äôs car.

Today, I sat in a chair while a friend ran her hands through my hair‚Äînot just a haircut, not just routine, but something deeper. A quiet offering of care, of comfort, of familiarity in a life that feels anything but.

And I felt it all at once, as tears rolled down my cheeks‚Äîthe sting of what‚Äôs missing, the weight of what‚Äôs changed, the strength and beauty we‚Äôve found in each other, and the quiet pull of what comes next.

We grieve the places that made us. The routines that held us. The life that we wore like a second skin.

But we don‚Äôt stay there.

We step forward. Into unfamiliar spaces. Into lives that don‚Äôt quite fit yet. Into whatever is waiting.

Maybe home isn‚Äôt a place at all.

Maybe it‚Äôs wherever love refuses to leave.

-Dr. Z

We see your texts, your DMs, your IG & FB GFM shares, we hear your VMs and if Junaed and I have not responded; our sincerest apologies as we're still catching up. The outreaches from every one of you from every corner of this world has been beyond what we could've imagined. Never in a million years we'd fathom this would happen to us, but it did; we lost our beloved home; the home we built & renovated with our very own hands (literally), our beautiful town, every shop, every tree, our children's preschool, our place of worship; our masjid (mosque) all burnt to ashes. We are still processing it all, we find ourselves feeling many emotions but amongst all the chaos, we see the blessings. 

We evacuated, we are safe, we are secure and most of all, we are surrounded by you all. The outpouring love and support from our friends, family, communities, mom groups from each of our kids' schools, our professional communities, our childhood friends whom are practically family-- all have come through to help us any and every way possible...everyone has been so incredibly kind and thoughtful as to going above and beyond for us that it has quite literally changed the state of our lives and getting us back on our feet so swiftly. 

We are hopeful that we will rebuild our beautiful Altadena, our home, we will replant every tree, the parrots and peacocks that often wandered by will return Insha'Allah. Please continue to keep us in your thoughts and prayers so that we could navigate through this all.

2917,eatonfire,socalfires,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DFn4RxoyVcI/,212999109,"Los Angeles, California","Neatly tucked inside the far right corner of my bedroom closet is a plastic container the size of a small trunk. It‚Äôs heavy, too heavy for me to lift on my own. It was placed there 17 years ago by two burly men, when I moved to LA and into my apartment. Its contents are very precious to me. It‚Äôs a lifetime of memories held in paper and printed form. It‚Äôs albums of photos I haven't yet digitized, it‚Äôs playbills of my sister‚Äôs theatrical performances since she was in college, it‚Äôs thick journals I wrote during my angst-ridden, passionate, coming out years; and it‚Äôs saved images from fashion and travel magazines that have awed and inspired me since I was child, sparking my desire to become a photographer. 

None of it has any material value. But its content and the container‚Äôs immovability have always been what I worry about first when I imagine a fire engulfing our building, or an earthquake turning that closet to rubble.

When the fires hit our city, I was in Florida with family. All I could do was watch in horror and anguish how in a matter of hours, entire communities and their individual histories were wiped off the face of the planet. Their own precious containers of photographic memories and decades of heirloom treasures, gone forever.

You can‚Äôt replace the irreplaceable.

I don‚Äôt expect any of the families affected by these fires to have the bandwidth or the desire to take family portraits in the coming months or year ahead. I certainly would not. 

But I believe someone like me can use my business resources and my time to support our community and support local funds that are helping them rebuild. To help them find ways to create new memories and to celebrate their resilience and hope.

So I will continue doing what I can through direct outreach and donations, in the sharing of resources and offerings from across our city. 

For the rest of the year, I can donate 10% of all business proceeds to the California Community Foundation.

CCF‚Äôs grant making prioritizes rehousing wildfire survivors, providing relief for displaced workers, reopening small businesses, and restoring essential community infrastructure.

I remember walking by this particular place and noticing how there seemed to me so much life going on inside‚Ä¶ And I couldn't help but wonder what life would be like here, it seemed so warm and inviting, but was also very very large as was, or so it seemed, the family enjoying it.  I had the impression there was something interesting going on in every room downstairs. Believe me, I'm not one to do a lot of peering into windows, it's actually something my companions on my walks always point out to me, things that they say, I never even go there, but in this case, that was the feeling. 

From my research, it seems there might have been a flower business here, perhaps run out of a home office.

A wonderful house in a wonderful setting, I'm so sad and sorry that it's gone.  Almost everything in this neighborhood was completely destroyed.

All burnt cars slated for removal were tagged as an EV or not.

When EV batteries are compromised by damage or heat, they become highly volatile. Exposed elements of the power systems can cause electric shock. Heat damaged battery packs can be susceptible to combustion, even after a fire is out. EV fires burn so hot that the current method of attack by firefighters is to let them burn out. Burnt EVs have to be removed with special care.

I‚Äôm not an EV hater like many classic car enthusiasts. But it hurts a little to see my car tagged by government because of EVs. It‚Äôs a process letting this car go. For now, it rests in the wreckage of my garage. Someday I‚Äôll show up at my home and the car and debris will have been taken away. And that‚Äôll be that.

My childhood home, school, park and entire neighborhood burned down in the Eaton Fire. It‚Äôs taken me a while to post about it because it‚Äôs truly heartbreaking to see so many cherished childhood memories turn to ash. The birthday parties with the incredible ice sculptures, the 30 girls from my class that would come over for sleepovers (yes all at the same time bless my parents lol), the neighbors that would pile onto the driveway to watch the cities 4th of July fireworks, the walks to school in the morning and hikes in the mountain in the evenings, the dance recitals at the park around the corner. Our house in the hills that held so many very dear memories in my heart. However it‚Äôs been incredible to see how the community has come together across Altadena, Pasadena and all of LA. I‚Äôm glad all family and friends are doing ok. The LA and Dena communities are strong and will rebuild. If you‚Äôre looking for organizations to donate to visit FireAidLA.org

And I don‚Äôt forget about our amazing staff and how we were and are truly family, customers had their own favorites who they‚Äôd love to see and converse with; felt more comfortable dealing with. That‚Äôs what I loved most about being at Ace. 

Watching TV and seeing people who I knew on a level some didn‚Äôt know. But the conversations they would have with a news reporter is; We Will Not Sell and We Are Going To Rebuild. Resilience, is what I love about the good folks in Altadena. 

But I promise, WE WILL BE BACK. Stronger than before and these recent events is going to bring us all together. 

You guys and gals fed my family and helped pay my staff; was never about gimme your money and get lost. Never. We wanted you there, with us. 

Like I have always said, I know the history of Altadena, knowing who was there before we arrived. So I always felt like a guest in your house/city. I love you all.

Today, I visited the Eaton fire burn areas for the first time, inspecting concrete foundations to assess their condition after fire exposure. One of the homes I designed in 2003 was still standing in its own way‚Äîstucco walls towering 8 feet high with no studs left to support them, and steel twisted from the heat.

We also met with past and potential new clients‚Äîneighbors affected by the fire‚Äîto evaluate their foundations and discuss their vision for rebuilding. Each homeowner created a wishlist of goals for their new home, marking the beginning of the next chapter.

Rebuilding after a fire is tough, but it‚Äôs also an opportunity to reimagine and create something stronger.

Says that some people will see increases more than the stated amount. 22% would be just the average of increase. Some people insurance will decrease which will cause others to pay higher premiums. Let say the average increase is 20% then if half of the people only pay a 10% increase that means the other half would have to pay a 30% increase. This should definitely not be allowed. The county is complicit in allowing any increases to happen. However, they are so concerned insurance companies will leave California they will end up bending to their will regardless if it hurts the residents dealing with this horrific event. Kathy Barger needs to not allow this happen. However. When it comes to big business she falls silent. She has yet to have criticism for SoCal Edison, the insurance companies, or the emergency system. We have to push back against these type of predatory practices. Please don‚Äôt  remain silent and let your voices be heard.

‚Å†
FireAid, which featured more than 30 acts including Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Nicks, and a surprise Nirvana reunion, took place at the Kia Forum and Intuit Dome in Inglewood on Thursday.‚Å†
‚Å†
In addition to fans inside the arenas, FireAid was seen by about 50 million viewers on 28 different streaming platforms, all of which offered viewers a chance to donate as they watched.‚Å†
‚Å†
The $100 million estimate announced Tuesday included sales of tickets and merchandise, sponsorships, large donations by artists such as the Eagles and U2 who did not perform, and contributions from the Irving Azoff family, Andrew Hauptman and Ellen Bronfman Hauptman, and more.‚Å†
‚Å†
The Los Angeles Clippers, whose home is Intuit Dome, covered operating costs. Steve and Connie Balmer, who own the Clippers and their arena, matched every pledge made during the broadcast of FireAid.‚Å†

How many relationships of yours have changed under the umbrella of those words, even though you knew full well it was them?

I feel like I'm in the throws of a bad breakup. I'm constantly reminded of all these things I had a relationship with that were lost in the #eatonfire.

Saying that it was just stuff is well meaning, but it's still like someone telling me that the person in the casket is in a better place despite that person having been a proud unrepentant sinner. It's meant to shift perspective into somethingpositive, but doesn't always track.

Yeah, some of those things I don't care about.

Other things cut deep. Because it isn't replaceable. It was an integral part of the story of my identity. It's like losing an organ I can live without, but one of enough significance I imagine I'll have phantom limb sensations for at least the foreseeable future.

And each of those phantom limbs prick and tingle, impairing my concentration.

But I've had a lot of conversations recently that weren't all about me or the fire.

I won't put any one else's business in the streets, but I'm seeing others suffering right now with recent tragedies of their own.

And if you're reading this and we commiserated in the past few weeks I see you. And I have no words that can provide adequate comfort, but it isn't for lack of seeking them.

I came across this self-portrait called ""The Rain Again"" that I took one night with my smart phone of my reflection in the kitchen window.

That phone pretty much stowed away somehow and was saved from the fire even though I've had two phones since.

I don't remember grabbing it, but the three rings I didn't take that were next to where I remember leaving it are all phantom limbs now.

Part of me wants to go back and clean this post up from all my mental meandering. But this is my real-time state right now and I think it's as important to show my current struggles as it will be to publicly celebrate my future triumphs.

Because as platitudes go, ""this too shall pass"" is one I can get with. I'll recover phantom limbs or no.

Because there is a significant difference in this heartbreak, and I'll explain what that is soon.",2025-02-05 04:28:46+00:00

This family photo was taken three days before the Eaton Fire.

The large park, once a symbol of peace with its constant bird songs, children climbing trees and running around, and the weekend farmers' market, is now changed.

Fortunately, my own home and family were safe, but friends lost their homes, and cherished places like parks, supermarkets, and cafes we frequented are gone.

It's been less than a month since it happened. Amidst the sadness, everyone is supporting each other, and I feel a strong sense of unity.

Having experienced the Kobe earthquake and knowing that recovery was achieved, I believe that, although it will take time, with everyone's cooperation, we can surely rebuild and look forward to a brighter future.

This was my first time making this drive since the fires tore through last month.

The devastation along the coast is absolutely staggering. Seeing the aftermath firsthand was heartbreaking‚Äîcharred landscapes, homes reduced to rubble, and a silence that felt as heavy as the grief in the air. At one point, I almost turned around because it was just too much to take in.

My heart goes out to everyone who has been displaced, to those who lost their homes, their memories, and so much more. LA is hurting, and today‚Äôs drive was just a small glimpse of that pain.

But through the ashes, there is hope. This city, these communities, and the people who call them home are resilient. We‚Äôve seen it before, and we‚Äôll see it again‚Äîrebuilding, coming together, and rising stronger than ever. The road to recovery won‚Äôt be easy, but light always finds a way through the darkness. Malibu, Palisades and Altadena will heal, and so will we.

This image shows how randomly the fire moved through Upper Hastings Ranch, burning some homes to the ground while leaving others with minimal damage only from smoke.
Growing up I had a lot of friends in lower Hastings Ranch which is the Eastern most part of Pasadena. Upper Hastings goes right up into the San Gabriel Mountains and as a teenager we liked to go up there at night for the view of the city lights. 
The Eaton Fire started around 6:15pm. When my buddy and I went to In-N-Out to eat at 11:40pm the guy in line behind us told us he had already lost his house in Upper Hastings. The Eaton Fire moved in three general directions after it started. The fasted part moved straight South along the East side of Altadena drive. At the same time the Eastern flank went along the mountains. It miraculously seemed to burn the mountains above Kinneloa Mesa before travelling further East and eventually into Upper Hastings Ranch. When Upper Hastings started burning the winds were high and it looks like the topography had a lot to do with which homes burned and which were spared. I am not sure how long Upper Hastings burned, the fire on that side burned along the mountain and eventually took out a few homes in Sierra Madre and Arcadia from what I know. All of Eaton Canyon burned and the third direction the fire moved was West along the mountain and sporadically down into the residential area. There were a few homes lost here but I think the wind direction had a lot to do with so few since it didn‚Äôt seem consistent in direction. Sometime after midnight the winds seemed to head mostly West and it was then Altadena got hit with a firestorm. The area between Allen and Lake, North of New York, burned well into Wednesday morning but the loss was sporadic since the winds had subsided.

It‚Äôs not just about needing rest. It‚Äôs about how grief rewires us, how loss fractures focus, how even the smallest tasks feel insurmountable when nothing feels certain anymore.

If you‚Äôve felt this, if you‚Äôve found yourself forgetting simple things, feeling drained by decisions that used to be automatic, struggling to keep up with a life that no longer moves the way it once did‚Äîyou are not failing. Your mind is working harder than it ever has to process change, to make sense of what no longer fits, to rebuild the instincts that used to guide you without thought.

Right now, even if it feels impossible, even if you don‚Äôt recognize yourself in this version of life‚Äîyou are adapting. Your brain is learning new rhythms. The weight you feel isn‚Äôt a sign that you‚Äôre breaking. It‚Äôs proof that you‚Äôre still here, still holding on, still finding your way forward.

It‚Äôs been a long month. We are meeting with our lawyers, adjustors, claim agents and everything in between which takes up a lot of time. We‚Äôve gone back a few times and found a few items, most just crumble in your hand but it‚Äôs still a bit of closure. Each time ‚Äúhome‚Äù we see neighbors and connect even more about this travesty. It‚Äôs such a beautiful community.

They have started the process of removing vehicles, propane and hazordous items off the property then comes the major clean up including inches of soil.

Everyone is in full white hazmat type suits as you drive around, it feels like we are living in the ET movie. Entering Altadena (and Palisades) it feels like time has frozen, my breath is taken away every time.

Trying to figure out whats next. Everything is a priority and everything is not. Sometimes I just wanna lay down and sleep for days but I don‚Äôt have that luxury right now. The ptsd is real. Reached my breaking point yesterday. What a mess. I look a mess lol.

Probably going to start documenting the process of grief and trauma. Losing my pictures and momentos and cards and notes from over the years really fucked me up. I love physical media. I love physical reminders of love and friendship and memories. But that‚Äôs all gone. How will I remember people now? My memory is foggy nowadays. I forget a lot. All my collections over the years. How will people remember me? What can I pass on to future generations for people to know who I am? For someone who fears being forgotten, losing it ALL has really done a number of my person. So maybe using social media will help me navigate that problem. Idk. Idk what to do anymore.

Chaos thrives on reaction, demanding urgency and noise, but it will never offer the wisdom that waits patiently within the calm. 

In stillness, intuition speaks, solutions unfold, and a deeper truth reveals itself; one that no amount of rushing or striving could ever uncover.‚ú®

Our team alleges SCE‚Äôs negligence in maintaining and de-powering high-voltage equipment contributed to the fire and underscores SCE‚Äôs failure to address wildfire risks, despite nearly 300,000 acres burned in LA County wildfires since 2016.

Four weeks ago today, Frankie‚Äôs incredible first-grade teacher, Maestra Georgina Sanchez, lost her home of 30 years in the devastating Eaton Fire. After evacuating to San Gabriel, she and her family of five are now working to rebuild their lives in Alhambra.

Despite everything, Maestra Sanchez returned to her Jackson Elementary classroom just days ago, showing the same warmth, dedication, and resilience that make her such a beloved teacher. Frankie and her classmates missed her so much - least we can do is support her and family through these incredibly challenging and uncertain times and show her how much she means to the kids at Jackson.

We are asking our incredible NS community far and wide to come together for a public school teacher who gives so much to our children.  Please share, spread the word, and help us make a difference. Every donation, big or small, brings her family closer to stability.

A homeowner forced to evacuate due to the catastrophic Los Angeles wildfires returned home to find a massive 525-pound black bear hiding in his crawlspace.

Samy Arbid said that the huge unexpected visitor was found when utility workers called  to restore power to his Altadena home after the Eaton Fire found their access point blocked. ‚ÄúI think during the fire he pretty much stayed in there,‚Äù Arbid said. ‚ÄúI think he was scared.‚Äù

Berry was too big to tranquillize and drag out,  so wildlife experts baited him into a trap with tasty food that included apples, peanut butter and rotisserie chicken. Within minutes, the bear walked into the trap and triggered the door. Berry was transported to the Angeles National Forest where he was given a welfare check and strapped with a collar before its safe release.ü•πüíó

Join Christiahn (@christiahn) on a mission to inform and protect our community against the toxic waste created and dispersed by the fires. 

Not everyone is aware of the invisible danger created in the wake of the fires. The burning of asbestos-filled drywall, PVC pipes, and lead paint along with various chemicals and plastics has created toxic waste that poses long-term extreme health hazards. Generous volunteers helping to remove debris are being exposed without the appropriate personal protection equipment. Even those adjacent to fire-affected areas are exposed to this waste from toxic particulate carried by the winds. 

How can we insure that all of LA‚Äôs communities, including those most vulnerable, are informed and protected? This collaborative effort aims to do just that. 

This project is currently seeking help in these areas:
- Artists
- Copy Writers 
- Subject Matter Experts
- Designers

Some of the most hazardous items from phase one of the cleanup are likely to end up in Arizona and Nevada, according to Michael Montgomery with the EPA, who is overseeing the cleanup effort.

Last week, Mark Pestrella, the director of county public works, announced that four local landfills would take in some fire debris, though exactly what is still unclear. But on Wednesday, he upped that number to 17 landfills across LA County and Ventura County, including in Simi Valley and Azusa, where material from five schools in Pasadena will go. An LA County Public Works spokesperson did not provide LA Public Press with a requested list of the landfills slated for use.

Montomery also did not answer LA Public Press‚Äôs question about where exactly the toxic waste from phase one of the cleanup will permanently end up. An EPA spokesperson also declined to provide LA Public Press with a list of the facilities.

And the effort was worth it. It carried me through multiple setbacks and allowed me to keep relative peace until I got the email announcement for this.

My entry in the Circle Foundation for the Arts Artist of the Year competition was put in barely two days before the closing date due to the #Eatonfire and all the scrambling and disruption that immediately followed.

But I got it in regardless, and out of 500+ artists, got a little bit of shine out of it.

So about those plans for 2025, part of it is raising my profile and this was the first of several initiatives I'm setting in motion in response to the losses and a recapturing of the potential I originally saw in 2025.

I refuse to cede this entire year no matter how bad it started.

Here are some steps that may help:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Acknowledge Your Feelings.
Allow yourself to feel the emotions without judgment. Writing in a journal or sharing with a trusted friend or counselor can be helpful. Embrace and notice your tears.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Seek Professional Support.
Therapists trained in trauma and resilience can help survivors process their experiences.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Engage in Community Support.
Being part of a supportive community fosters connection and collective healing. As the rebuilding process begins, it can also give meaning and purpose to one‚Äôs life.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Practice Self-Care.
Activities that promote physical and emotional health, such as regular exercise, mindfulness practices, or spending time in nature, can help regulate stress and enhance resilience. A simple walk with a friend can renew one‚Äôs energy.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Focus on the Present.
While it‚Äôs natural to reflect on the past, grounding techniques‚Äîsuch as noticing sights, sounds, and sensations around you‚Äîcan anchor you to the present moment and reduce distressing thoughts.

Mindfulness practices like the Community Resiliency Model (CRM) provide practical tools for managing distress and reconnecting with a sense of well-being.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Participate in Faith Communities.
Many faith communities continue their ministries even though their church, synagogue, or temple may have been destroyed.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Engage in and Notice Acts of Generosity.
This engagement activates brain circuits that support well-being, whether witnessed, received, or given. 

Human beings can cultivate skills that directly influence the strength of the generosity circuit, so try to participate in acts of generosity.

It has been completely eye-opening to me to witness their presence all around the community. If you have the means, I strongly encourage you to donate or volunteer to this amazing organization. As soon as I get my wits about me and get a little bit more steadier on my feet, this is the first organization I plan to put my money and energy toward. They 100% support the community with no judgment, and with all the warmth and love people experiencing tragedy need in the moment and throughout the horrific process of trying to figure out next steps.

She üïäÔ∏è was so intelligent, beautiful, and gentle. She üïäÔ∏è was very private and reclusive person that kept to herself. I would call her the hermit of the family because Evelyn üïäÔ∏èwould rarely leave her house to show up for functions. However, every time I had a big event she would get out of her comfort zone and come show me support. I remember the entire family being in shock to see her at my high school graduation, my wedding, and kids birthday parties. What they didn‚Äôt know is I would go over, sit, and have talks about religion for hours. That was our thing to talk about different religions and spiritual beliefs and before you know it 2-3 hours had passed. It is truly a shame that her death will be used today by Al Sharpton, Ben Crump and his team of lawyers as a rally to score political points or capital. This is definitely something she would not want. Like I said she üïäÔ∏è was a very private person so to have a memorial and rally in her name with most people in attendance not even knowing who she üïäÔ∏è was while alive is a bit weird. In fact my sister and I use to joke with my parents that if we ever died and the police were involved whatever you do don‚Äôt call Al Sharpton. So I refuse to partake in this dog and pony show. I refuse to be a pawn for those individuals who live, profit, and thrive off of black pain and grief. If Crump and his team truly cared about my family they would have met us weeks ago instead of meeting for the 1st time today at the memorial. If they truly cared they would have attended my cousin üïäÔ∏è Chanell‚Äôs funeral on January 17th and met the majority of our family. I don‚Äôt want a penny from Crump. I want Kathryn Barger who claims she cares and is fighting for the people of Altadena, yet has not reached out to victims families to be held accountable. I want SoCal Edison who has ripped off the people of Altadena for decades to be held accountable. I want the county of Los Angeles and whoever is in charge of the alert system to be held accountable.

We understand the concerns about notices residents have received regarding vehicle towing. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

üî• Why were vehicles towed?
‚úîÔ∏è CHP was directed by Fire Command to clear burned-out vehicles from public roads to restore utilities & ensure access for emergency crews.
‚úîÔ∏è Tows followed California Vehicle Code 22669(d) & were conducted with CHP-authorized rotation tow companies (which have fixed rates).
‚úîÔ∏è CHP does NOT receive fees for these tows.

Need help?
üìå Concerns about towing fees? Contact CHP to report service issues.
üìå Insurance claims? If you received a tow invoice, reach out to your insurance provider for guidance.
üìå CHP assisted in identifying VINs so insurance companies can properly compensate vehicle owners.

We know this is a challenging time, and we‚Äôre here to help. Please share this info with affected residents.

Since we are getting inquiries asking about this effort, we will clarify. The main question is ""How did they get it so right?"" THEY LISTENED. 

They convened. They asked the community, and they listened. Our part is one small corner of a large universe of empathetic, intelligent listening.

Experienced megafire / disaster communities will recognize the structure and, like us, wish this was possible for everyone. It's what you all do or have done, with massive support.

We love this.

**************************
Our Approach

Provide project management support to ease the burden of rebuilding.

Facilitate community organizing to ensure voices are heard.

Connect communities to each other and to vital resources.

Invest in and support expert-informed solutions to shape our collective future.

We met some lovely, inspiring people who are doing their best to get back to normal, and preserve what they loved most about their home. More from them soon on @newshour 

Here‚Äôs some of what I saw in Altadena, CA. I‚Äôve covered so many different extreme disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires) and each has a different fingerprint in the way it rips up and distorts the order we try to put on the world. Captions below. 

1. A group from the California Conservation Corps carry a large filter (it's basically a mesh sock filled with mulch). They ring these around burned homes and cars after a fire to try and prevent any additional toxic runoff from the sites ending up in the local water system.

2. The interior of a burned out car with the windshield glass melted down onto the steering wheel.

3. Inside a shipping container on a building site.

4. A rivulet of melted steel. These are all over the place. 

5. Besides various metal objects (washing machines, bedsprings, etc), dishes and pottery are often the only recognizeable household items left after a house burns. 

6. Ruined out home in Altadena

7. ""NOT EV"" is spray-painted on all the non-electric cars, to signal to clean-up crews that they don't need to remove a gigantic lititum-ion battery from the wreckage.

The @cdglocal892 was one of three locals with a sign up for slots of times with an advance schedule. 

I figured this volunteering with #local892 would be easier for me with my 11 years of retail experience in, woman‚Äôs clothing at @thelimited (‚Äúthe limited‚Äù you try finding a store location. That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs ‚Äúlimit-ed‚Äù.) 

And I was right. I choose sorting clothes and labeling. My memory of what to do on the sales floor kicked into gear and I started organizing the sizes. The clothes were already hung on my rack. After sorting the sizes it was onto labeling the clothing sizes. What wasn‚Äôt known with labels on sizing on particular clothing (and I looked everywhere‚Ä¶ back of the neck, and it‚Äôs two sides of the garment) I placed off to the side to notify my costumes supervisors later and got it done. 

I got to meet people from the @directorsguild (last photo), and @ialocal871 (second photo with my supervisors to our volunteering.) 

Thank you so much, #local892 for setting up the volunteering schedule. I hope to volunteer again March 3rd with my husbands niece when she visits from the University of Hawaii.

If you are a local member and are available, please volunteer to help with our local fire victims. It will benefit you and our members. @iatselocal695 @695ywc

My efforts are to creatively and accurately capture the moment I‚Äôve stumbled upon as a photographer. But when it‚Äôs devastation to something so familiar, when they are my streets that have been destroyed, my town, the houses and shops I‚Äôm used to passing by, I can‚Äôt help but be paralyzed, stop and stare. 

I regret not capturing more that day, but the shock of this fire definitely took its toll. Sometimes silently staring at the devastation to process what has happened is all you can do. After viewing it all, I returned home smelling like dirty, toxic smoke from head to toe. I showered in a bathroom lit by a lantern and returned to an unheated bedroom to reply to concerned friends and check up on those who were displaced and in worse conditions than me

It‚Äôs the end of another busy week and like most others in my neighbourhood, it feels like this event was so long ago but just yesterday.
I woke up feeling a little down and deflated, but it‚Äôs also been grey and rainy for days which I‚Äôm sure is affecting my mood. 
My next task is getting the full property list started. It feels daunting and I‚Äôve been kinda avoiding getting to it. For some reason I went through the entire house the day before and took video of everything. Watching that, I‚Äôm sure will affect me.

I was down to my last week of installing, lighting, and cleaning up for my first studio visit since before the beginning of the pandemic. The visit was scheduled for Jan. 15. The fire blew through Altadena on the 7th/8th. Too many people lost everything. My studio is still standing. I am not yet sure what I still have. I am determined to salvage my art. I am one of the lucky ones. My heart breaks for everyone. I cry every day on my drive to my studio. My drive takes me through a nightmare. My work for this ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù is/was several years in the making. Work sits unfinished. Installation sits unfinished, lighting unfinished.. Cleanup can‚Äôt even get started. Waiting. Waiting for insurance adjusters. Waiting for a conservators. Waiting. The gallery side of my studio needs the least work. That art has the least amount of ash/soot‚Ä¶whatever. However, full remediation will still have to be done. The gallery feels/looks like a magical oasis in the middle of a war zone. My main work space, smells like a barbecue, and several areas have a layer of ash. In order to remediate the entire building, my options are few, and the logistics are a nightmare. I have collected a lot of materials that are heading to the trash. No need in keeping anything but that which is salvageable. No need in salvaging that which is easily replaceable. Meanwhile‚Ä¶waiting. The last picture is of ash on a couple of small proofs on a table, below one of the windows where some of the ash came in. #kiravollmanart #eatonfire #altadenastrong #kiravollman #mixedmedia #surrealism #laartist",2025-02-07 18:15:31+00:00

Many lost their homes and business, including my friend Jacob, owner of @acesmokeshop1altadena , who lost his sm0k3shop - a well-loved staple on the main street (Lake Street) of this beautiful town.

---

Not only did Jacob provide a warm and welcoming environment for his patrons, but he is a pillar of the community, allowing all sorts of small businesses to set up stalls in front of his shop.

üôèüèªüåπüôèüèª

In spring of 2022 (on my way back to Nor Cal from Las Vegas) I got the opportunity to visit Jacob at his shop, and walk along the scenic streets of Altadena. An unforgettable moment of my life.

From that day forward, up until this tragic fire, Ace Sm0k3sh0p had been the only store in Southern California to carry Herba Rosa botanical teas. Since my original post is gone, I thought it fitting to immortalize this moment in memory of this beautiful city.

---

I truly believe in the Spirit of Altadena and it's people - their ability to rise from the ashes and come back stronger than ever. Like a Phoenix. This spirit lives strong within Jacob, who has selflessly used his time and platform to provide help and service to the svffering people throughout the recovery effort.

---

Please follow his page @acesmokeshop1altadena
and if you want to help the recovery of this business and support the employees he had provided for, he has a gofvndme l1nk on his page.

Any contribution is appreciated, but I know many folks are struggling right now, so a simple like on this post will help spread the word.

Thank you! üôèüèª

It‚Äôs been such a sad, heavy and confusing time. I‚Äôm just so sorry and deeply heartbroken for my city. It‚Äôs beyond comprehension and truly unbelievable how reality can shift so drastically, so quickly. The utter devastation from the fires, and implications for individuals and our city are unimaginable. While I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôm safe, I‚Äôm heartbroken for those communities, people, animals, and wildlife who aren‚Äôt as fortunate. To those who have been affected or impacted, please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers during this incredibly difficult time.

I‚Äôm an LA native and I love my city so much. LA always has, and always will be, my home. I even have an LA tattoo; my very first tattoo that I got at 19. Pic two is little water baby me in Malibu, a city that is now unrecognizable. My heart has been so heavy seeing the devastation caused by these fires. There‚Äôs this element of grief because there are memories made in parts of the city, and in communities, which have been completely wiped. Neighborhoods just vaporized.

Thank you to the brave and incredible first responders who have been working non-stop on the front lines - firefighters, law enforcement, the national guard, paramedics, pilots, mechanics, DWP, etc. They‚Äôre the real heroes.

I‚Äôm deeply moved by our community coming together, uniting, and supporting one another through this time of hardship. The strength of our community shines brightest as we work toward recovery. When society inevitably begins to move on and focus on the next ‚Äúthing‚Äù, I pray people will continue to donate, volunteer, amplify victims‚Äô stories, foster displaced animals, share resources, and help rebuild communities. I invite you to lead with compassion, kindness, patience, and most importantly - love.

If you are looking for ways to help, I‚Äôve added a highlight where you can find all the resources I‚Äôve shared thus far.

I love you, Los Angeles ‚ù§Ô∏è Together, we‚Äôll rise stronger than ever ‚Äî because that‚Äôs the LA way.

I took a walk around Altadena on February 2nd, exploring the aftermath of the Eaton Fire, which has since reached full containment, and I've seen many structures either damaged or completely destroyed. I also brought Twilight Sparkle over at Charles White Park, where the majority of the park is still there, but the playground and a facility were involved by the fire. I also checked on Altadena Elementary School at Calaveras & El Molino (not pictured), and it was still intact. I then ended the tour of the Eaton Fire Burn Scar in Pasadena, where several structures were damaged or destroyed at Walworth & Highland. Hope everyone is safe inside the shelter during this difficult time.

I have to ask myself this daily. At least once.

Overwhelm is seldom far away we were going through a difficult stretch before the #EatonFire. And when it hits, I come back to that question of one thing I can do right there in that moment.

Answers thus far have included:

* Making a call or sending a text sometimes to take care of some business that needs handling, but also sometimes to someone who can just lend an ear.

* Crying

* Resting/sleeping

* Tidying up something

* Making one of these posts

* Working on some of my 2025 objectives 

* Streaming something to make me laugh, wonder, or sit in suspense 

* Breathe

There are a few other choices I've made, but these have been regulars this past month.

I had my first therapy session yesterday and I found one idea particularly helpful.

She said that depression and anxiety are the common cold of mental health.

That tracked for me, because I feel like I have parts of grief inside me that are incubating. And my goal with therapy is address my mental health before this 'common cold' becomes pneumonia.

As hard as some days are and as badly as I want to curl up in fetal position, I refuse to accept that this my lot in life.

And it's okay that there's too much out of my control to resolve the things stressing me at any given moment.

I can always find one thing I can do right then at that moment, that may not affect the issue at hand, but still sustains me even if for the next ten minutes.",2025-02-08 04:19:56+00:00

My mom is day by day struggling with pain and with hope. I‚Äôm here to thank each one of you who directly reached out. Offering all that you can for my mom. Strangers stepped up.  Loved ones donating and giving what they could. LA is not how they portray it on tv.  True angels showed up. No words on how grateful I and my family are.  It‚Äôs gonna be a long haul for the recovery process.  We are all hands on deck in her life right now and her future. Shining light on her new home. It will stand proud on the foundation that my Dad built for his family of six in Altadena in the 1960‚Äôs.  Also in lock step with our neighbors who are working together to keep our family homes and enjoy our lives once again in such a beautiful place.  I will keep you connected to the process. I want you all to be part of the good news. Because of your direct donations. Continued support and encouragement and most of all your direct hugs and love to my mom. I love you for more than I can express. You are an integral part of this rebuild.  These photos are of what‚Äôs left of my mom‚Äôs home. It may sound cliche but we will rise from the ashes.  It is an emotional roller coaster. I never wish anyone to be forced to evacuate. I never wish for anyone to lose their homes. This is hard. This is heavy stuff.  But you all showed up. You have us in your prayers.  Never did I think I‚Äôd be part of the affected in a moment of silence at a Laker game. Or watching concerts on tv raising money for our burned homes. We never think it‚Äôs gonna happen to us.  I hope those from a distance come with me. I‚Äôll show you around Altadena. I‚Äôll show you blocks after blocks of nothingness.  But awaits for a rebuild full of love. Don‚Äôt separate yourself from this.  Keep thinking of ways to help. Not just my mom. The residents of your neighborhood are in need.

I particularly loved these bowls and their glaze combinations of matte black with amber celadon rims, and remembered thinking selfishly if I should keep the set for myself, but I ended up choosing the worst one of the bunch as a keepsake and gifting the rest. 
I found that bowl in the rubble of our home the other day, with a patina of ash from its second firing, and felt immensely grateful my siblings had their sets tucked safely away in their cabinets.

It cuts a hole in your chest and drops a bowling ball there that you have to lug around while you pick up the pieces and triage your life.

The update after the #EatonFire a month ago is that my head is constantly foggy. The rental market is hot garbage. I‚Äôm emotional, exhausted, distracted, irritable and worried about many others in our #Altadena community that I hear about.

I still can‚Äôt grasp that this also happened on the other side of LA in Malibu and the Palisades. I still cry looking at Google satellite images of our town. I cried in the car this morning. I guess this is grief.

Much of this month I felt like I was watching this all happen to someone else... my little brother taking me shopping at Target, nervously talking with FEMA at makeshift disaster centers, screaming on the phone with renter‚Äôs insurance, telling the Red Cross yes we need disaster assistance, and digging through toxic ash and twisted metal 3 different times for proof of our previous life.

I don‚Äôt know how me or Danny could have gotten through those frantic first weeks without the help and generosity of family ‚ù§Ô∏è friends and strangers. We‚Äôve cried over their generosity many times.

Even this week, more tears as I received a new turntable and vinyl records from a group of my friends who banded together to help us start over.

We didn‚Äôt do a fundraiser. Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll realize how much stuff we need to rebuild until we move into a new place with pretty much nothing to move in. Maybe then we‚Äôll ask for help...uncomfortable as that will be.

Right now we‚Äôre trying to pay it forward by checking on and helping out neighbors (now friends) who lost much more than we did.

Thank you to our family for going above & beyond üíú

Thank you a THOUSAND times over to my cousin who has given us a comfortable place to layover in üôè

And thank you for reaching out over the past month. I may not have been able to respond but please know I saw you, I heard you and I appreciate you.

I am saddened that this had to be the first post of the year.
The LA County Fires of 2025 burned the livelihoods of so many down to the ground, leaving more than 40,000 acres, 16,000 structures and dozens of lives destroyed. It was by far the most destructive event the city has ever gone through.
I personally experienced a prolonged power outage and extremely hazardous air quality for days, but so many people had to abruptly leave their homes and belongings behind, and for some, for good. That‚Äôs a scary thought, I thought, and it can happen to anyone.
Much anticipated rainfall came after almost 9 months of drought, just 2 weeks shy of the start of the fires. It helped with containment of fires and lifted some of the road blocks, so the residents were finally able to return to their homes, now looking nothing like how they left it.
I had a privilege to volunteer in Altadena with @dj2high @parukaokay @yoshihiro_imae @ringdabingo thanks to generous support from @pocarisweatusa to donate and distribute #PocariSweat to the first responders in the burn zones and had an opportunity to document the aftermath.
My heart goes out to everyone affected, especially to those who stand up to do what they can in support of the community. The City of Angels really showed resilience and compassion in the wake of this unprecedented catastrophe.

My plan was to kick off my series Relics on Substack on January 12, 2025.  I spent the month of December planning out my content schedule and compiled a list of music for upcoming writings and reels.  I sorted through boxes of pictures and old newspaper clippings, watched family videos and did a deep dive into my family tree. 

I was full of inspiration and felt the spark of creativity as I sat in different coffee shops around Cypress, Texas, preparing for this series even after a long day at the office. 

Then things took an unexpected turn.

As we witness extreme wildfire events like the Palisades and Eaton fires in tandem with our government seemingly going up in flames, I argue that the flammability of our socio-ecological systems are not all too different; both are at risk due to legacies of poor management and extractive capitalism, both endanger the working class, and both can be made to be more resilient to change - as long as we adjust our relationship to it. 

This is me trying out a different style compared to my typical scientific writing (psst: our recently accepted manuscript on my research will be available soon). As a scientist, I align with groups like Extinction Rebellion who argue that scientists can no longer afford to be complacent or ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù when it comes to the climate crisis or capitalism, things that touch so many of our lives and our study systems. 

I don‚Äôt really have the time for ‚Äúcontent generation‚Äù or crazy formatting, so enjoy this notes app stream of consciousness - after all, I‚Äôm just a girl!!!! üë©‚Äçüî¨üå≤üî•üìù

2237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DF3YZ5FSSo3/,212999109,"Los Angeles, California","Been deliberating on what to share for the 50TH POST. The answer presented itself last night as I went where the wind blew me around town. Here's one L.A. Woman's Saturday night:

üåá1-2 An event at the Barnsdall theater proved a bore and a guy sat next to me reeking of pot, so I ducked out early and caught the sunset. Time at @barnsdallpark is never a wash.

üëó3-4 Motored from there to Pasadena for a clothing swap at Remainders Creative Reuse. This volunteer-run arts and crafts supply thrift store and maker-space is doing so much post-fire community work. Keep up with them @remainders_creative_reuse

üòû 5-6 I was a regular at Remainders a few years ago when I had an art studio a little further up Lake at Boston Street in Altadena. The whimsical 1930s studio building (built by the landlord's father) burned in the Eaton Fire. I decided it was time I visited the site. 

üñºÔ∏è I'm holding a benefit art sale for @shannonosullivantattoo who lost her business in the building. See pinned post on my art account for details @allisonstraussart 

üè°7-8 Also visited the bungalow court on nearby Maiden Lane where I'd once hoped to live. I hadn't qualified to rent there as the landlord understandably wanted someone with consistent income, not a freelance writer + artist.  Talk about a blessing in disguise! 

üìºüçï 9-10 Driving home, no one would let me over, causing me to miss my turn. This happened to be near my parents' house, and I was hungry, so I pulled over and called them to see if they wanted to have dinner nearby. They said they were eating pizza and watching Josie and The Pussycats and I should come join. Hadn't seen Josie since my sleepover days, forgot about the boyband ""Dujour"" plotline üòÇ (10)

Here were my clothes, records, camera bag, all my paintings, photos and prints by artist friends, here were my inexpensive but irreplaceable trinkets from around the world, film negatives and journals and creative tools and love letters and heirlooms and photos and little fragments of my soul outside of me -‚Ä®I guess I thought I‚Äôd find a trace of them, but anything that was left in that room was completely covered by roof shingles and other people‚Äôs remnants of home - there were three apartments upstairs and the ceiling caved in so - anything we had now shares the same resting place in a pile of roofing, melted glass, metal sludge, bits of tile, stone and ash. The whole neighborhood is kind of like that now - we all share the same pile of rubble - our individual homes and belongings became unrecognizable identical ash and debris, sharing the same pile of rubble and floating on the same gusts of wind

But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the landlord‚Äôs library 
Tucked in a thin hallway and the only part of the home that still had a semblance of a post-fire roof coverage, this one little sliver of debris strangely preserved from wind and recent rain -
I never saw it in waking life (wow - I just wrote this automatically and realized what I implied - ‚Äúwaking life‚Äù as if this is a dream - üíî)
Anyway, I never saw the library before the fire, that‚Äôs what I meant -
But now without the walls separating our apartments I went inside‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt much left to determine that it‚Äôs a library except book-shaped ash piles with crisp edges of pages and even some words still legible (photo 9) - it‚Äôs all so surreal - I reached out to touch and turn a page and it dissipated into a puff of air - disappeared before my eyes - earth to fire to air and gone on the wind

Since they started burning a few weeks ago we‚Äôve been donating & volunteering wherever & however we could. Seeing so many communities & places we deeply love + have spent endless amounts of time in across LA just decimated has left us (like so many others) sick w/grief‚Ä¶ just wanting to do anything we can to help. Being on diff sites we did multiple things & got to see + learn firsthand the do‚Äôs & don‚Äôts for donations. A lot of people have the best intentions & mean well but often we were seeing people donate things, seeing it as an easy feel-good way to get rid of what is often just trash, not considering the aftermath. It really creates a burden on the facilities¬†receiving them- most of these places like the Sanita Anita Race Track and YMCA are temporary setups- they rely on volunteers to sift through, sort & organize the donations. The amount of time we saw utterly stained, severely damaged (you know we love a distressed look but this was not it) clothing & random, unwashed intimate basics was astonishing. Yes, under garments & socks are highly requested items but your stained underwear is not needed, seriously. Just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should!!

Since the fires have been contained, the immediate danger is subsiding so ‚Äúcrisis mode‚Äù across social media will be turned down, headlines are gonna fade & donations + volunteers will wean off. It‚Äôs crucial to recognize that the real work to rebuilding & recovering is just beginning though. The same energy when the fires first hit is needed more than ever-disaster relief isn‚Äôt a relay, it‚Äôs a marathon. Support, community, acts of service, donations - it‚Äôs all still needed. Being on the ground firsthand, we‚Äôve learned a few things + tips we want to share that we hope will aid people in how to relay their time, money & resources to make the most impact moving forward. Continue to give generously but with intent & def donate with dignity but don‚Äôt forgot to also consider the environmental & human impact of your actions ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è

I‚Äôve had quite a journeyüíñ, I was rescued on January 11th after the Eaton fire, found all alone by the freeway in Pasadena. I waited and hoped my original family would come back for me, but they never did. Thankfully, I‚Äôve been in the loving care of @realestatevanessa and the @pasadenahumane-Pasadena Humane Society, where I‚Äôve been safe, happy, and showered with love. Now, I‚Äôm officially ready for adoption and can‚Äôt wait to meet my perfect family üíó‚ú®

A little about me:

üê∂ Full of Energy & Playful ‚Äì I love to run around outside, feel the wind in my fur, and enjoy every moment of fun!
üêæ Super Affectionate ‚Äì I‚Äôm a cuddle bug who gives the best kisses (hope you don‚Äôt mind!).
ü¶¥ Eager to Learn ‚Äì I may need a little guidance, but I‚Äôm a smart girl who‚Äôs ready to learn with the right person!

I have so much ü©∑ love to give and would thrive in a home where I feel safe, cherished, and part of the family. If you or someone you know can give me the love and care I deserve, I‚Äôd love to meet you! Let‚Äôs create a lifetime of happy memories together. üè°üíñ

For your Spanish Sunday, I'm paying tribute to the Spanish and Mediterranean style houses that were, I believe, destroyed in the Altadena Eaton Canyon fire. 

These are from my own library of photos of the area, and I continue to search through my archives to see what else I can find.  Of course there were many more affected, very sadly.  I wish I had documented the entire region, but alas, that is not the case.

I also want to make note of my disclaimer, because it's very difficult to tell about some houses on the maps. As far as I know, these have been lost, but I am more than happy to be proven wrong.

Please go back through my posts if you did not see those about chimneys, and particularly my post that is simply a statement. I am offering to photograph homeowners with the remains of their homes, or just their homes, or just them. I'm also happy to find my own photos of anyone's house if they would like me to look.

I will be doing some regular posts again, but that doesn't mean that this situation is forgotten in any way. I think I'll be thinking about and posting in memory and honor of our Los Angeles residential architecture fire losses for a very long time.

Rebuilding after fires is not just about restoring what was lost‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to create a home that‚Äôs safe, resilient, and future-ready.

Building for Fire Resilience

Concrete Type 1 Construction:

‚Ä¢Non-combustible: Concrete doesn‚Äôt ignite, offering unparalleled fire resistance.
‚Ä¢High heat resistance: Maintains structural integrity under extreme temperatures.
‚Ä¢Durable: A sustainable investment designed to last generations.

Advanced Fire Suppression Systems

‚Ä¢Automatic fire defense: Sprinklers activate instantly to stop fires before they spread.
‚Ä¢Dual protection: Deploys water and fire-retardant foam for maximum safety.
‚Ä¢Blue Roof Design: Integrates exterior sprinklers, fire-retardant coatings, and smart weather monitoring for real-time fire mitigation.

Exterior Fire-Resistant Coatings

‚Ä¢Acts as a barrier, preventing flames from penetrating the home‚Äôs exterior.
Metal Roofs
‚Ä¢Fire-resistant and durable, designed to reduce ember penetration risks.

Lessons from the 2018 Malibu Fires

The Malibu fires underscored the need for innovative solutions. During this time, we developed the Blue Roof Design, which expedited rebuilding by meeting safety codes and bypassing roadblocks.

Recognized by the AIA, our homes incorporated:

‚Ä¢ICF concrete for unmatched fire resistance.
‚Ä¢Integrated sprinklers for interior and exterior safety.
‚Ä¢Sustainable systems for long-term resilience.

A Safer, Brighter Future:
Rebuilding after loss is hard, but with the right materials and technology, your home can be beautiful‚Äîand resilient.

Jones pictured here receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Joe Biden at the White House on May 3, 2024 in Washington. (The White House/X). Clarence and his wife Ann Norton [daughter of publishing giant W.W. Norton) lived on Highview Ave. in a Gregory Ain house. When Martin Luther King flew to Los Angeles in early 1960 pursuant to an invitation from the World Affairs Council, he was under indictment for perjury in Alabama in connection with his filing of a supposedly fraudulent tax return. MLK‚Äôs lawyers in New York had identified Jones as the Lawyer they thought might be better employed in the civil rights movement than entertainment law. Dr. King asked to meet Dr. Jones who offered his home in Altadena as the venue. On a Friday night, MLK was ushered into the Jones‚Äôs home and shown the room with a living tree and a retractable roof the better to see the San Gabriel Mountains and the Milky Way, the lemon trees, flowers, and plants that were Ann‚Äôs avocation. ‚ÄòNice house‚Äô, said Dr. King.

We need your support - please like, share, donate.

Creating multiple volunteer strike teams to fight California wildfires - to protect human lives and health, nature, property, and the normal way of living without fear, smog, and evacuations. 

We need your help to buy used fire engines,¬†each with at least a 1000-gallon tank, to equip and deliver them to California. 

It will be an alternative and independent powerful force that will assist local firefighters and hotshots to overcome fast-spreading fires with additional fire engines, men and water or will protect places where no one comes to help. 

The condition of wildfire management system in California is highly critical, especially in LA where it is incompetent and even looks like a sabotage, and it will not change on its own quickly. Something must be done about it before it is not too late again.

I saw the caller ID and knew before I picked the phone up that the call was going to be a difficult one to take, but I told my sister before that no matter what I was going through I'd always pick up the phone.

We were at a Super Bowl party, so I took the call off to the side of the room.

""Mom just died,"" my sister told me.

The call didn't last long after that.

I'm way past the point of counting the amount of things to navigate, emotions to process, and battles to fight.

I told my sister I would be out the next day, but gave a time I couldn't make because we had a plumber coming out to our new place to resolve three issues that had been dogging us for weeks.

We didn't stay on the phone long.

Somehow, as hard as everything is, and as hopeless as I felt this morning after waking to an email where I was disqualified from receiving aid from an artistic institution for fire victims over some arbitrary crap, I can't seem to just give in to it.

I spent the day with my sister remembering times with our mother while actively attempting to dodge around the events that fed and bred my traumas. We took care of what business we had the energy to face.

Tomorrow we deal with more.

In between I fought some of the other battles raging through emails and hoops to jump through.

But there's one thing that I keep coming back to--the communities I'm surrounded by.

Yes, I'm deploying every coping skill I've developed over the years and reinforcing those with therapy. . .

. . .but having the people I do around me provides me cover during the moments I need to just not be in the downpour for a few minutes.

And that's no small thing.

For all the things the #Eatonfire took, the one thing it's made crystal clear. . .I have the most amazing people one could hope for tucked into every nook and cranny of my life.",2025-02-11 06:09:14+00:00

With all the ways our community has been affected and with so few vending opportunities for our businesses at city events, the City of Pasadena - Public Agency needs to create MORE opportunities to strive during such a difficult time. For many, our businesses, side-business, and legit hustles play a huge part in supplementing income required just to stay a part of this community. MADE IN DENA has already donated thousands of dollars worth of brand new merchandise to those affected while almost half of our customers lost their homes, so not being able to vend at our own annual festival is definitely not the best idea by the City of Pasadena - Public Agency. However, we will continue to support wherever we can through donations, volunteerism, and providing work for those affected. Thanks to everyone who make a constant effort to support local business and much love to everyone affected by the recent tragedy.

The Chef's Special was a hot sandwich with turkey and chicken salad with cranberries. 

Their location is adorned with photos of jazz music icons. 

Their original location in Pasadena is just a couple blocks from the Altadena burn areas. From the early days after the fires, they opened their doors to be a place of refuge and assistance for the community. 

In addition to sandwiches, they have hot dogs, ice cream and smoothies.

There is an almost certain likelyhood that a very dangerous amount of rainfall is approaching the Eaton Fire area leading to dangerous conditions for debris flow and mudslides.
 
Edgar McGregor, the meteorologist who saved hundreds of lives with eerily accurate predictions of the storm that causes the Eaton Fire, just issued another warning in the Altadena Weather-Climate group: ‚ÄúThis evening, the PGE-WRF continues to put out rather alarming rain totals and rates for our area. I am concerned about this one, but again, forecasting for debris flows has not been my forte. The ECMWF also appears game for decent jet dynamics, ample moisture of 1.2 precipitable waters, and 40 - 50 MPH winds at 2,500‚Äô running head on into our mountain slopes.‚Äù

LA meteorologists are also echoing the warning, urging those in the immediate vicinity of the burn scars to consider short-term evacuation as the rain pours in overnight.

Be very careful Sierra Madre!

Our hearts are heavy for our community, for the families who lost their homes, and for the deep scars left on a place we cherish.

Altadena is more than where we do business ‚Äîit‚Äôs home. For over 10 years, we‚Äôve been restoring and doing our best to honor the character of homes in Pasadena and Altadena, bringing them back to life with care and craftsmanship. We‚Äôve been fortunate to work alongside talented, hardworking people who pour their skill and heart into every build.

Losing several of the homes we‚Äôve loved and invested in has been heartbreaking. Seeing our community in pain is even harder. We are devastated‚Äîbut we are also determined.

For now, we‚Äôre back to work, currently restoring a beautiful home in nearby Eagle Rock. But our commitment to Altadena remains steadfast. We vow to be part of the rebuilding effort, to stand with our neighbors, and to help our community rise again.

Altadena, we‚Äôre with you! #AltadenaStrong #EatonFire",2025-02-12 17:22:56+00:00

Who shows up. Who stays silent. Who tries to fix what can‚Äôt be fixed.

And sometimes, the hardest part isn‚Äôt the loss itself, but the way it reshapes the people around you. The way absence ripples outward, leaving unexpected empty spaces where support should have been.

If you‚Äôve felt that loneliness‚Äîif you‚Äôve looked around and wondered who‚Äôs still standing beside you‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone.

Not everyone will get it right. Some will say the wrong things. Some won‚Äôt say anything at all. But somewhere in the quiet, there are people who won‚Äôt turn away. The ones who see your pain and don‚Äôt try to erase it. The ones who don‚Äôt need you to be strong to stay.

Those are the ones who will walk with you through the wreckage. And when you‚Äôre ready to rise, they‚Äôll still be there.

The wildfire that developed in Jasper in July 2024 took over 80,000 acres of forest and a large part of the townsite. 
The LA fires in January 2025 came within a few blocks of our family‚Äôs home in Altadena. Luckily their subdivision was completely spared and they are safe. 

Forest fires are happening all over the world and are becoming far too common.

Not only do these sections of the insurance code protect homeowners from tricky insurance tactics like ‚Äúdepreciation,‚Äù but it also provides that after a declared federal disaster, such as the Eaton Fire, (#lafires ) they must provide additional living expense (ALE) coverage for policyholders for a minimum of 24 months. This ALE coverage may be extended for up to 12 additional months.

You can thank attorneys like our very own Robert Jackson for getting legislation like this passed into law!  Robert has played lead roles in wildfire litigation for over twenty years. If you lost your home to the #eatonfire you want Robert on your side.

Robert, Scott and Eric are all heavy hitters when it comes to fighting insurance companies! These three have a combined 100 years of experience with insurance bad faith lawsuits, and they are offering LA fire victims help with their insurance claims FREE OF CHARGE.

My Uncle and Auntie bought their first home in Altadena in 1972. They went on to raise a literal village there and they had ‚Äúthe house‚Äù we went to celebrate anything. Birthdays, funerals, pool parties, Tyson fights, etc. I almost drowned in their pool, but I also learned to swim there. My Uncle Leo has since passed and my 97 year old, Auntie Dottie, was still there until the AM hours of of 1/8/25 and had to be forced out the home she‚Äôd spent 53 years. By mid day it was confirmed that the house had burned to the ground, a total loss.  1 of 9,400+ that were taken by the winds of the Eaton Fire. 

It‚Äôs really impossible to understand the loss of this community until you see it with your own eyes. Social media, phones and television doesn‚Äôt capture the scale of destruction. I went to witness it for myself and to do what I‚Äôm best at to help. The profits from the sales of the ‚ÄúAltadena Street Runners‚Äù will go towards the GoFundMe of my Auntie Dottie. This is just the start of where I can help and lend support, in the present. This is going to be a long journey to rebuild this community.

I‚Äôve walked through the remains of homes I spent years designing‚Äîplaces where families celebrated life, where carefully curated details turned houses into homes. Now, they exist only in memory and scattered fragments of what was left behind.
In some cases, those fragments were eerily intact‚Äîpottery vessels, blackened but unbroken. Metal barstools, still lined up at the ghost of a kitchen island, the kitchen itself reduced to rubble. Objects meant to be lived with, loved, and passed down through generations, now standing as the last evidence of spaces that no longer exist.

Losing my work this way has been emotional in a way I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. But that pales in comparison to the heartbreak of watching people I love lose everything.

The devastation is profound, yet so too is LA‚Äôs resilience. If there is one thing Angelenos do well in the face of catastrophe, it‚Äôs help our neighbors. I‚Äôm proud of the way my colleagues and friends in the design industry have come together to help. I know we will all have an important role to play in the rebuilding of beloved communities. My hope is that our heartbreak and deep respect for LA‚Äôs landscape and the character of its diverse communities will guide our efforts in the years to come.

Last year I created a coloring book inspired by the wildlife and natural beauty of The San Gabriel Mountains, a place that has always been my home. Since the devastating Eaton Fire, which has deeply impacted our community and the landscapes we love, it feels like the right time to share this project. The San Gabriel Mountains A-Z
Coloring Book was meant to celebrate the mountains, but now it feels like a way to honor and give back to those impacted by this tragedy.
I‚Äôm committed to donating a portion of sales to support victims of the Eaton Fire. It‚Äôs my small way of fostering healing, offering hope, and celebrating the resilience of our community.

CalFire and the California Geological Survey have identified post fire risk to life, property and infrastructure, outlined in the first image. 

Guidance from CalOES (California Governor's Office of Emergency Services)

The incoming storm could bring an increased risk of power outages, flooding in small streams and low-lying areas, and debris, rocks and mudslides on roadways.

Residents are encouraged to not drive through flooded roadways, prepare in advance for power outages and reduce injury risks from falling limbs and trees by staying inside during high wind events.

Residents are urged to stay informed and listen to local authorities about actions they should take including evacuation orders or safety recommendations. In burn scar areas, officials recommend preparing for possible sudden debris flows by having a go-bag packed and knowing evacuation routes.

The idea is to celebrate creativity and have some fun. But this is quite different.

Admittedly, I first photographed this house because I was fascinated by the formations that have been created by the way the hedges have been cut. I especially noticed that the lower one looks kind of like a fish or a whale, it's almost topiary! But not quite‚Ä¶ 

And now, sadly, I have to report that this house is gone. And it's particularly strange and sad, and deserves a giant  What The Heck?! Because it is the one house that burned in a neighborhood that was pretty much completely saved otherwise.

This is an example of an ember flying through that horrible wind storm and just happening to land in this place. At least as far as I can tell‚Ä¶ 

So what the heck to that! I really feel for these homeowners. There are so many different situations that one can find themselves in when it comes to this disaster. Some people lost their home and everyone around them did as well.  That's devastating because you've lost your home and your community. But you're not alone in it‚Ä¶. Some people find that their's was the one house that was saved in a neighborhood that is otherwise destroyed. In that case, they usually can't go back and live in that home because there's nothing around them and it's completely toxic. So, much as they are able to get their things, a lot of them have to be destroyed as well due to toxicity. That must be an extremely frustrating situation to be in, and they have also lost their community. And I think there's probably some strange guilt feelings that some of those people may experience, sadly.  And then there's this situation, where everyone is fine, I don't even know if there is a toxicity issue because there are several blocks here that were completely saved, and yet there's this one house that burned to the ground.

Of course my heart goes out to everyone in all of these situations. Each one is difficult and tragic and heartbreaking.

Case Study House # 20, also known as the Bass House, was built for famed graphic designer Saul Bass by Buff, Straub and Hensmen. The Case Study Houses were known for steel frame construction, but the Bass House was notably made of wood. Unlike other post-and-beam designs by the firm, the structure has no overhangs due to the number of trees around it, among them the deodar cedars that line the stretch of Santa Rose Avenue nicknamed ‚ÄúChristmas Tree Lane.‚Äù In a stroke of luck (for some), the property and Christmas Tree Lane, which are both listed in the National Register, survived the Eaton Fire unscathed, while two structures across the street were destroyed.

- Homeowners who suffered fire or smoke damage.
- Landowners who suffered property damage.
- Business owners whose businesses were impacted in any way.
- Anyone who sustained any personal injuries due to the fires.
- Anyone who was forced to flee the fires.
- The heirs of those who did not survive the fires.

Sadly, even properly insured victims are coming to a shocking realization. Their insurance may not provide enough coverage to compensate for all their damages. Damage to fencing structures, irrigation systems, and expensive landscaping could very well not be covered by many insurance policies. In addition, claims for emotional distress and fleeing the zone of the danger can only be recovered against the utility company and/or its subcontractors.

Why does a fire victim need a lawyer now?

If the fire victim has insurance: 

- A lawyer will help a person put his or her best foot forward in making his or her insurance claim.
- Insurance only covers a small part of the losses.
- Insurance companies often cheat.
- Most losses will be recovered from the power company and its contractors.

IF WE REPRESENT YOU, WE WILL NOT BE TAKING A FEE ON ANY MONEY THAT YOU RECOVER FROM YOUR OWN INSURANCE COMPANY.

If the fire victim does not have insurance:

All of the losses will need to be recovered from the power company and its contractors.

Sahag Mesrob Armenian Christian School, my school of ten years from pre-k to eighth grade, burnt down by the Eaton Fire.

My first steps onto the campus and I couldn‚Äôt comprehend what I was looking at, I was experiencing denial and disbelief. I was looking at rubble. The buildings where I attended class, made friends, went to chapel, played music were simply not there. It was suddenly non-existent.

I stood where we would stand as children, facing the pillared structure in our plaid uniforms where our Principal Filian and teachers would lead us into the Pledge of Allegiance and the Armenian Lord‚Äôs Prayer. Where we would line up on the red lines of the square waiting to be picked up from school.

I walked the path down that leads to the front of the school, where I expected to find more destruction. What I saw next made chills run through my whole body, there in the rubble standing tall was our school‚Äôs khachkar. A fully demolished building behind it yet, there it was, strong and proud with its carved Armenian cross. That chilling moment I will never forget.

Strange to see in these photos, the juxtaposition of me as a child on a thriving school campus, then me as an adult on demolished school grounds. 

I‚Äôm proud of my resilient community that believes in this school, my schoolmates and old teachers who‚Äôve banded together. We will continue to support the current students and teachers as classes continue. We‚Äôll rebuild.

Some context: I grew up in Pasadena, CA. My parents still live there. Because of the Eaton Fire in LA at the beginning of the year my childhood home was almost lost (it's ok, they're ok, no one I know was physically hurt), but so many other's in my life weren't so lucky. 

In the last few weeks I've been grieving the loss of my hometown as I remember it. These memories are an ode to Pasadena/Altadena.

As I drove down the 405s fwy, I saw a plume of smoke rising out over the Palisades. After turning on the radio I learned that a fire had just broken out on Sunset Blvd, so I decided to get off at the next exit after Sunset and head directly for the beach. I was not prepared for what I was about to see‚Ä¶ 

I have lived in Los Angeles my entire life. The last time I saw a fire that upset me as much was the Woolsey Fire in 2018, but from the get go, this was DIFFERENT. I parked my car and literally sprinted down to the ocean. My heart hurt, and so did my lungs, even with a mask. People were crowding down on the strand and the Santa Monica Beach in astonishment. I took some photos and hurried off to see my Dad in Torrance. By the time I arrived, he showed me a video of a bulldozer crushing abandoned cars out of the way on Sunset Blvd, where I had just been only a mile or so away. I was in disbelief. I think we all were. 

It‚Äôs been a little over a month and I still have my animal carrier by the door, my apartment is a complete mess, and my mind has not recovered, nor will our city ever be the same. So many people I know have lost what can only be surmised as priceless pieces of their lives. Everyday I think how I can live my life with more intention, how I can give back to my community in a valuable way, how we can work to prevent something like this from happening again. To those who have lost so much, and to even those who only watched in horror, we will rebuild, and while it will be different, what‚Äôs come to pass will not be forgotten. I stand in solidarity with my community at large, and I promise I will make more purposeful how and why I use my camera, because never before has truth needed a larger stage in which to be seen. Tomorrow is Valentine‚Äôs Day, but love isn‚Äôt all about gifts and candy, it‚Äôs about being a support, understanding the pain of others, and standing by those in need.‚ù§Ô∏è #eatonfire #palisadesfire",2025-02-14 02:12:27+00:00

The crumble of books, pages swirling like paste. Chimneys left standing, the lone remnant of a home, mocking the roof, walls, windows that have faded into mud. Burnt cars frozen in time - as if they were left behind decades ago. Entire neighborhoods vanished. Christmas decorations strung, frozen grey amid the void of color on a tree. The smell of ash and smoke lingering, hovering over the skeleton of homes and refusing to leave. 

‚ÄúTherefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.‚Äù Matthew 7.

Well, we‚Äôre already using the Radicle at our site in Altadena, and here‚Äôs what the sensor will be doing at 8‚Äù below the surface:
 
Measuring Soil Carbon Loss & Recovery
üå±Detects reductions in soil organic carbon (SOC) due to fire.
üå±Tracks SOC increases as microbial activity and organic matter return. 

Monitoring Soil Respiration & Microbial Recovery
üå±Measures CO‚ÇÇ flux to assess microbial respiration and biological recovery.
üå±Compares pre- and post-remediation respiration levels to track progress.

Detecting Soil Contamination from Urban Debris
üå±Helps identify suppressed microbial activity from heavy metals, PAHs and dioxins.
üå±Helps determine areas requiring further soil testing.

Assessing Biochar & Fungal Remediation Effectiveness

The first post-fire measurement at this site in the photo (for which we don‚Äôt have a photo) was 972ppm.  A week later, there was an overgrowth of oxalis, and the measurement was 1285ppm.  Pre-fire measurements ranged between 1780 to 1831.  If we get persistent high readings, that may suggest continued decomposition of fire residues.

DISPLACEMENT. These are words I had no experience of before the Eaton Canyon fire. But now, these are words that I say out loud at least once a day. 
.
Our life turned upside down on the night of January 7th when we evacuated from our home. Luckily, our home is still there, but it‚Äôs inhabitable because of smoke damage and (possibly toxic) ashes, which came in from every window and doors.
.
We had to move out and find a new place to stay. It was not easy but we made it (with some good help and good luck!).
.
Now, we are learning how to live with ‚Äì and bear ‚Äì this uncertainty. The uncertainty of not knowing what‚Äôs the best thing to do. The uncertainty of not knowing when we‚Äôll be able to go back home. The uncertainty of not knowing. 
.
We are learning. We are learning how to deal with the insurance, the contractors, the remediation and cleaning companies, the environmental hygienists. This has become our second job. It‚Äôs often frustrating and overwhelming all at ones. But it is what it is. We still need to deal with all of this unfortunately. We need to push through.
.
Our beloved Christmas tree is still at home with its decorations on. Time froze in there. It‚Äôs weird like my daughter said the other day. This is NOT how I envisioned this year. This is NOT how WE imagined this year. But this is our new ‚Äúnormal‚Äù now.
.
THANK YOU to everyone who‚Äôs showing up for us
THANK YOU for your kind words, for your virtual and real hugs, for your thoughts 
THANK YOU for the time and THANK YOU for listening
THANK YOU for taking care of us, for cooking for us, for offering your help, for offering clothes and shoes, for sending us toys and stuffies, for welcoming us in your home
THANK YOU for these beautiful flowers that I received from my child‚Äôs teacher today, unexpectedly.
.
These are the most amazing gifts. Every day, there‚Äôs something I am thankful for. And the warmth I feel when I think of my community made of new and old friends showing up for us really means everything to me. 
THANK YOU ‚ô•Ô∏è

May we try(!) to believe in our ourselves. To believe in our inner strength, to believe we can sift through discouragement and persevere to something that is good.

May we try(!) to remember that we have gone through hard times before, to remember what helps us through the hardest of times. 

May we try(!) to cling to the people and things who support us, to cling to hope and to the possibility of hope. 

And may we also try (!) to let ourselves laugh, smile, and be lifted up‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs by Disney characters, a favorite song, or a movie that sparks joy. (Thanks, @therock, for this timely and hope-infused reminder from Moana 2!)

PS my original post had the phrasing ‚ÄúNow is the time‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúMay we try‚Äù. I intentionally decided to change it because I realized 1.) MLK used that phrasing in his ‚ÄúI have a dream‚Äù speech and I wanted to give full honor to him and his words by not using the exact phrasing that he used and 2.) ‚ÄúMay we try‚Äù is more in line with me and what I was hoping to convey. :) I will post a reel soon on this same speech!!

What once felt effortless‚Äîgathering, celebrating, marking time with traditions‚Äînow carries a weight I never anticipated. Holding both joy and grief at the same time can feel dissonant, like trying to sing two notes at once. The table looks different. The celebrations feel different. And yet, love remains.

Maybe that‚Äôs exactly why love matters more now than ever. Because in the midst of loss, love is what rebuilds. Not in sweeping, cinematic moments, but in the quiet ones‚Äîthe way someone pulls up a chair for you in your grief, the way laughter still sneaks through the cracks, the way even fractured traditions remind us we are still here, still connected, still choosing each other.

Psychologists call this dual awareness‚Äîthe ability to hold both joy and sorrow, to acknowledge loss without letting it erase everything else. It‚Äôs not about forcing happiness; it‚Äôs about letting love meet us where we are, exactly as we are.

So if this season feels different, if absence makes celebration feel heavier, know this: Love is not in the perfection of the moment. It‚Äôs in the people who show up, in the presence we offer one another, in the quiet knowing that even in the hardest seasons, we are not alone.

And today, I just want to say thank you to this beautiful community, to the familiar faces who‚Äôve been here, to the new ones who‚Äôve joined. You are part of what makes love feel expansive, even in the hardest of times.

-Dr. Z

‚Äî-
The City of Pasadena has been working closely with LA County, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Caltrans, and other neighboring jurisdictions to determine haul routes for the Phase 2 Fire Debris Removal Program. As shown in the attached map, three haul routes have been defined for the Pasadena/Altadena area:
¬∑  West of Lake Ave: Woodbury Road to Arroyo Blvd to I-210 on/off ramps
¬∑  East of Lake Ave and west of Eaton Canyon Golf Course: New York Drive to Sierra Madre Villa Ave to Rosemead Blvd to I-210 on/off ramps
¬∑  East of Eaton Canyon Golf Course: Michillinda Ave to I-210 on/off ramps
 
Trucks hauling debris from the burn areas to the I-210 freeway will utilize local streets until they reach the haul route, and from there will utilize the haul route to access the freeway.
 
A significant amount of truck traffic will be utilizing these haul routes, and signal timing will be adjusted to accommodate the additional traffic. The City reminds residents to be patient and drive safely if they experience the additional truck traffic along these haul routes, as this is a critical part of the rebuilding process and recovery effort.

The Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center (PJTC), a cornerstone of the community since 1921, was tragically destroyed in the Eaton Fire. Originally founded as Temple B‚Äônai Israel, this historic congregation stood for over a century, serving as a place of faith, culture, and connection.

On January 7, 2025, the flames took everything the sanctuary, chapel, classrooms but not the spirit of the people. Before the fire reached the temple, community members saved all 13 Torah scrolls, ensuring their survival. A powerful reminder that while buildings can be rebuilt, faith and resilience are unshakable.

Nicole, a wonderfully warmhearted homeowner who lost the charming bungalow that she lived in with her partner and teenaged Daughter in the Eaton fire, was kind enough to give me the honor of photographing her with what remains of her home. 

She was with Disaster Relief California who help fire victims dig for buried treasure. And she found some lovely things‚Ä¶ Scroll to see the video showing what survived.

Nicole has the best attitude, she's so positive and appreciative of all the help. I know she'll get through this as well as one possibly can.

Most of the treasures that are left at these sites, especially at this point, are simple things, family heirlooms, possibly not of any great value monetarily, but extremely valuable in terms of the memories they hold and legacy they represent.

I want to emphasize that these areas are still being heavily patrolled, so anyone who has any thoughts about doing such digging on someone else's site best put a stop to that immediately. First of all, it's totally unacceptable, these people have suffered enough. 
Secondly, you will be caught and you will be thrown in jail and rightfully so. 

I'm pretty certain that most of my followers, if not all, would never think of doing such a thing, but just in case‚Ä¶ 

I have included information on my chimney project if you scroll to the end. Simply send me a DM. I'm spending the weekend documenting the area because the trucks are moving in and pulling things away, including these lovely chimneys that represent so much. I feel compelled to photograph as many as possible but it is truly daunting‚Ä¶ There are so many!

If you will be in the area and have a house you'd like me to photograph, with you or not, please reach out to me! 

I hope you all enjoyed your Valentine's Day and that you will have a beautiful Saturday!

As always, my heart goes out to all who are suffering from the fires, I'm always thinking of you.

When we got married in 2016 I had been introduced by a Haworth colleague to a hat/headpiece designer from California. Her name is Andie & her co. is called The Feathered Head.

She is such a talented designer, and also a chicken lover! She had her own little flock & would occasionally use their dropped feathers in her work. And although my headpiece didn‚Äôt have any of her chickens feathers she did send me 3 feathers from her flock in my box as a lovely little extra.

I‚Äôm a bit of a sentimental gal, so I‚Äôve kept these feathers all these years. ü™∂ ü™∂ ü™∂ 

A few weeks ago I saw a post on social media from Andie that on Jan 8th they lost everything in the Eaton fire in California. Their Altadena home, her studio for The Feathered Head, her husband‚Äôs recording studio, and all her beloved chickens.

Well my heart broke for them. So as soon as I started messaging Andie, I knew what I had to do. Send her feathers back to her, as she had nothing left of her beloved flock. And I couldn‚Äôt just send the feathers‚Ä¶I had to do a little more‚Ä¶

That being said, I have been humbled by life this year in ways that will require faith and hope no matter which way you slice it going forward. My hometown is burnt to the ground. We are headed into 5th week of the trump Presidency and the news seems to be getting more horrifying with everyday that passes...Respite comes in different forms for people. I had a friend who shared that in the midst of losing everything in the Altadena fires, TikTok brought some modicum of giggles, and that indeed was a tiny daily respite for her.  It is in that headspace that I am going back to basics and asking myself: what is the one thing that has always been, no matter what, an expression of faith and has also provided respite for me? Easy answer, music. I maintain that songs are my tattoos. 

In 2021, when broadway was shut down, I decided to embark on a project inspired by one of my favorite creative minds, @mirandajuly , the #30day artist challenge, which I embraced as  #30days30songs. I know for a creative career we have to engage with SM, so I am picking #mirandajulys project back up again as a healthy means by which for me to engage, and to impose external growth when one doesn‚Äôt feel it on the inside.

Finding Hope in the Ashes
Today, I had the privilege of serving a family affected by the Eaton Fire in Pasadena, California. Although the Eaton Fire area remains closed to the public, I had the incredible opportunity to get there with the help of friends and partners.

As we began our search, our focus was on reclaiming the precious jewelry and souvenirs lost in the burning ashes. It felt like we were gold miners, sifting through the remnants in hopes of uncovering hidden treasures. Incredibly, the mother found her son‚Äôs collection of crystals, which brought back beautiful memories of his childhood.

As I continued to filter through the ashes, my heart raced when I discovered a diamond ring amidst the debris. Friends around me also unearthed home decorations that the mother had lovingly gathered over the past 20 years. Despite the devastating loss, the family‚Äôs deep faith in God stood as a beacon of hope that inspired me to maintain joy, even in the toughest of circumstances.

Serving in disaster areas is more than just a task for me; it‚Äôs my passion. This experience reinforced my dedication to earning resources that allow me to help others in need. 

My wish for everyone is to remain safe and well, spreading love and support in challenging times.

The fires may be out, but the weight of what was lost still lingers. And now, as floods wash over what‚Äôs left, it feels like devastation upon devastation.

But here‚Äôs what I know: we are not alone in this.

For the past five weeks, through the ashes, through the wreckage, through the unbearable, it has been your words, your presence, your unwavering kindness that have carried me. Every message, every comment, every moment of shared grief and quiet understanding‚Äîit has meant everything. It has been a lifeline.

Because grief does not live in isolation. Loss may be personal, but mourning is collective. And this city, this community, this vast network of hearts‚Äîboth here in LA and across the world‚Äîhas proven that even in ruin, something unshakable remains: each other.

So to those still standing in the embers, to those learning how to exist inside the after, to those who refuse to let grief be carried alone‚Äîthank you.

Thank you for reminding me that even in a world that often feels terrifying, at the end of the day, all we really have is each other.

And that? That is everything. üíõ

After 30 days in a hotel, we are finally back home. The past month has been a whirlwind‚Äîphysically, emotionally, and mentally exhausting‚Äîbut stepping through our front door again feels surreal.

It took two weeks of intense restoration to make our home livable again, including:

‚úîÔ∏è Full insulation removal & replacement in the attics
‚úîÔ∏è Attic encapsulation to seal in safety
‚úîÔ∏è Air duct cleaning to remove any smoke & toxins
‚úîÔ∏è Textile removal‚Äîevery piece of clothing, shoes, rugs, and curtains sent off for cleaning (for months)
‚úîÔ∏è Deep cleaning‚Äîevery room, every cabinet, every drawer, every single spice jar!
‚úîÔ∏è Air scrubbers‚Äîrunning for days to clean the air 

Unfortunately we‚Äôre not done, all blinds and mattresses are a total loss and need to be replaced - this is likely why we still smell smoke in parts of the house. This process has been overwhelming, but we are beyond grateful to have a home to return to.

‚ÄúFire victims deserve to know their property is safe before rebuilding. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers‚Äô decision to reject the communities‚Äô calls for additional soil testing after debris removal and topsoil excavation is completely unacceptable. 

‚ÄúFrom past wildfires, we know that toxins and carcinogens can be found in soil deeper than six inches. It is incomplete and irresponsible to limit the remediation to six inches without checking for additional health hazards.

‚ÄúThe Eaton and Palisades fire victims must not be subjected to hidden cancers and illnesses from toxins lurking in the ground.

‚ÄúI call on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reverse its decision and truly fulfill its vital mission of helping fire victims recover and rebuild with confidence in a safe environment.‚Äù

This was my local hardware store, a small, family-owned True Value franchise. Altadena Hardware had been around for 80 years in this spot. I bought many tools and supplies here, all of which burned in my garage. As I replace my tools, I‚Äôd give anything to buy them from the friendly folks at Altadena Hardware, and not Home Depot or Amazon, but that‚Äôs no longer my world. 

This building also held a small, locally-owned bicycle shop, Steve‚Äôs Bike Shop, where I took my son‚Äôs many bikes over the years when they needed new tire tubes or other repairs, or to pick up accessories like bells and kickstands. Several years ago, he and I stripped an old kid‚Äôs bike down to the metal and rebuilt it together for him. The bike shop was a wonderful resource for that project, in supplies and shared knowledge. 

Also housed here was the Wellema Hat Co., an old school hat-maker that made felt hats by hand using vintage tools. As a fedora guy myself, I‚Äôd stop in there to gawk at the artistry of the headwear and the charm of the store itself. I never got a Wellema hat as I was waiting for our home‚Äôs mold remediation to be over. I thought I still had time. 

There were other businesses in this old, brick retail building. They may not have been as meaningful to me but they were part of other people‚Äôs stories. They were all part of the heart of Altadena. 

As you can see, I have a history of photographing my cars with this building, all part of daily driving classics. Bonus photo of my former Porsche 944.

The grief is settling in now, but so is something else: a bond, unshaken‚Äînot just by tragedy, but by resilience. By something ancient, something untamed. We are Wildborn.

What tried to take everything left behind something even stronger‚Äîa community that refuses to fall.

This isn‚Äôt just about rebuilding. It‚Äôs about remembering. It‚Äôs about rising. It‚Äôs about standing shoulder to shoulder, knowing that when everything changed, we didn‚Äôt turn away‚Äîwe held the line for each other.

But where do we put all of this? The loss, the resilience, the heartbreak, the hope? A home for every story, every scar, every step forward. That‚Äôs why I created this space. A place to grieve, to heal, to rebuild‚Äînot just what was lost, but who we are. To navigate this in-between together.

We are more than where we come from. We are more than what we‚Äôve lost.

We don‚Äôt just survive. We grow. We rise. We stand. Together.

Mew is sweet, friendly, snuggly, confident, loves everyone he meets,¬†and has never met a lap he didn‚Äôt like. He‚Äôll follow you around, chirping and purring for affection. And when you come home, he‚Äôs the welcome wagon, flopping on his side.¬†

Almost three years old, Mew is still very curious and loves to play. Some of his favorite¬†activities are leaping for the Cat Dancer, chasing lasers, and bouts of hide and seek with his human friends. As self-appointed chairman of the Neighborhood Association, Mew also likes to lounge by the window to watch birds and all the goings-on.¬†

Because Mew has star quality, he will do best as a solo kitty in a home without dogs, other cats, or young children. Ideally his new parents will work from home since Mew prefers not to be alone for long stretches!¬†

Mew is a tad¬†chonky so will need to be on a wet-food-only diet and have parents that can help him slowly trim down. Also, due to his curiosity, Mew has a tendency to be a door dasher so it is very important that you take precautions (and not have a door that faces a busy street. 
This wonderful boy has been through a lot. Let‚Äôs give him his Act Two. For all the love you give, he‚Äôll give back double.

This weekend we will host, alongside SoLA Beehive, an Altadena residents and Eaton Fire survivor-focused Drive this Saturday, February 22nd, in a BIG WAY! 

This all-day drive will be all-encompassing so we look forward to seeing you then !

All of our inventory was sorted and separated equally before any distribution took place, all in our efforts to serve each community equally in the best way we can. 

‚Äì A tale of two towns¬†‚Äì

For the past month, at the United Methodist Church in Venice, we have been loving inspecting and sorting through over 10K units of generously donated and gifted new and like-new garments that are just about ready to find their new homes in the hands of deserving survivors and persons affected by the LA Fires that have torn through their home towns.

Our tireless volunteers and @bymadre team made sense of the inventory and merchandised it in a way that it would provide an experience of ease, delight, and hope for survivors preparing for this next chapter of their lives. Earlier this month we services Pacific Palisades.

This following weekend, our drive will feature: 

featuring lovingly curated new & carefully inspected like-new & vintage clothing for ADULTS & CHILDREN from brands like:

Petite Plume
Hill House Home
The Who Shirt Company
Felicity & Coco
Sail to Sable
Brandy Melville 
AGOLDE & Citizens of Humanity
Industry of All Nations
...and so many more.

We look forward to greeting you!

Stopped by Sierra Madre Self Storage to see if anything was available, in case we recover anything from the ashes of our home. 

Jennifer Waldon, who runs the place, told me I'd be at the end of a long waiting line. But we got to talking about our shared love of Altadena, and the friends she had there who lost their homes. She pulled out a photo of Christmas Tree Lane in January 1949, dusted with snow. A much more beautiful January than we saw this year!

It was gifted by a friend who left Altadena and fires for Florida, only to find a different kind of climate danger. Even so, Jennifer, a lifelong resident in this area, is thinking Florida may be in her future as well. 

She may not have storage space for me, but I will definitely visit again when we settle in her town. #altadena #resilience #sierramadre #eatonfire",2025-02-19 00:23:58+00:00

The reporter really really captured what we do, why we do it, how we do it, and the impact on the ground.

We are so proud to see Brad Sherwood highlighted alongside Jennifer Gray Thompson + Jenn Kaaoush + Casey Taylor and more.

This means everything:

""After the Fire were the first people that made me feel at all better about any kind of future that we might have, because they‚Äôve been through it,‚Äù said Rabbi Amy Bernstein, who lost her home in the Palisades Fire alongside hundreds of other families in her congregation. ‚ÄúTruly, it‚Äôs the first time that I felt any kind of hope that we will come through this as a community.‚Äù

üîµüîµüîµüîµ

Authentic Altadena Town Council Vice Chair Nic Arnzen had connected with After the Fire USA earlier in January at a webinar for reeling Altadena residents. His council census tract, including the mountain area of Altadena, suffered some of the worst destruction, with total destruction across up to 80% of the area. His family was among the 5,000 of the tract‚Äôs 5,500 residents whose homes were destroyed.

Arnzen had already led tours of the Altadena burn zone for others ‚Äî politicians, journalists, bureaucrats ‚Äî but the experience with the delegation of fire survivors was different.

‚ÄúSeeing in their eyes, ‚ÄòI know what you‚Äôre going through‚Äô ‚Äî there was a kinship that can only be forged through these terrible fires that was palpable,‚Äù Arnzen said.

Thank you to Emily Wilder.

1543,altadena,eatonfire,thishouselives,stillthere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DGPR7tBJu1j/,812348069,"Altadena, CA","Hello my friends, it is Tudor Tuesday and I am happy to report that one of my absolute favorite Tudor revival homes located in one of the most beautiful areas of Altadena has survived. I already had that indication from looking it up, but I felt much better seeing it right there in front of me. 

And yet the news isn't all good for this house. Scroll to the end for a little clip showing what it's like to live there now‚Ä¶ It was just one of the few that survived, when all around it there is destruction. I've seen that so often‚Ä¶ One amazing house surrounded by such sadness, I know I've mentioned it many times, forgive me if I am continuing to be ridiculously redundant!

Today as I tried to take advantage of the last vestiges of light as I documented yet another neighborhood in Altadena that has been burned to the ground, the thought came to me that this is a moment in life, and I suppose you have experienced them as well, when I wish there were three of me that could do different things at the same time, one of which would be sleeping, because there's definitely not enough time for that!

By now you may know that I am a ridiculous night owl, so I don't get to take advantage of every bit of daylight, and the days are short! So I'm racing with the sun, and racing with the bulldozers, trying to document everything I can before they take it all away as if it never was there, as if it didn't matter. 

If I am not being responsive, please forgive me, I'm just doing my best with the juggling right now. But know that I appreciate you immensely... ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî‚ù§Ô∏è

This week, the @altadenamountainrescue presented our team with a plaque recognizing our support during the Eaton Fire. The truth is, we didn‚Äôt think twice about being there. That‚Äôs what this job is about - showing up for each other, for our fellow teams, and for the communities we serve cumulatively.

To our friends at Altadena Mountain Rescue - thank you. Not just for this honor, but for the way you lead, for the way you serve, and for always having our backs. It was a privilege to stand beside you. Know we‚Äôd do it again, whenever and wherever.

valentines day has passed, but my love for my friends persists year round üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è @beenymph has continually been such a dear friend to me, and together we've embarked on so many creative ventures!!! 

unfortunately, during the eaton fire in altadena this past january, milena's family home and job have burnt down, and when i asked them what was the most helpful thing to do to support them, they said to book them! 

as milena is a professional photographer, having clients to shoot and therefore having work and an income is more important than ever- theyre such an amazing artist, and they would love to be able to create art with our community while supporting themselves financially. these are trying times for everyone, and being able to mutually support each other is something that is deeply important for myself and milena

shooting this set was an absolute delight, as most things are when i hang out with milena! our initial plans for a location didnt work out so they ended up coming over to my place, and armed with 15 dollars worth of fake roses, goth clompers, and a dream we COOKEDDDD 

im so excited to share this set of queer and disabled celebration and resilience, and if you or you know anyone who is hankering to have a photoshoot done, ples book my dearest @beenymph !!!!!",2025-02-19 04:36:01+00:00

üî• WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME ‚åõÔ∏è

As of today 2/21, the majority of rescue organizations have withdrawn efforts and there are only a handful left with support slowing down. In just a few small Palisades neighborhoods alone, we have 10 cats confirmed to be alive before the storm‚Ä¶ and there are countless more out there across these massive burn zones. Just last night WUFAW rescued one of these cats. It takes a lot of patience and effort to go out and re-bait/set new traps daily. With manpower and resources dwindling, our odds are stacking against us.

The rescue organizations are spread thin as is, and understandably they have to shift their focus back to the rest of the SoCal animals that desperately need their help. By next week there may be only a couple organizations out trying to trap and bring these animals home. My mission remains the same. With your help we don‚Äôt have to give up on our furry friends.

This was never about money for me. I had no idea how massive this operation was going to become, otherwise I would have asked for support when I first started this mission. Because we‚Äôve reached such a critical point in our efforts, we need to be out there around the clock before we lose our chance at rescuing the remaining survivors. In order for me to continue full time and keep my business closed, I need YOUR support.

Even $5 can make a difference. If you can‚Äôt donate, please share the fundraiser link. Every share spreads awareness and helps bring these pets home.

Let‚Äôs show these animals that they haven‚Äôt been forgotten. Donate link in bio üôèüèª

We still have a house, but we can‚Äôt go back yet. 

I‚Äôve been in survival mode, living out of bags, holding it together for my babies. We will go home again, someday. For now, we are working to make it livable‚Äîsorting through what we‚Äôre keeping, letting go of what‚Äôs been damaged. Fire restoration crews come and go. 

The water is still unsafe. Patience wears thin, but ridiculous optimism keeps me steady. The days blur together. Weeks slip past.

Driving through Altadena, I feel the weight of it all‚Äîgrief, disbelief, the ache of a community forever changed. The healing will take time.

üìè 25 Miles ‚Äì Moderate Pace ‚Äì Social & Training Ride
‚ö†Ô∏è Beginner ride for road bikes (hybrids are ok) 
üó∫Ô∏è Riding through the city, catch the LA river north, and loop back through NELA 

We know there‚Äôs a lot of gatekeeping and ego in the road bike male-driven cycling scene. Too much road bike-shaming, too many people acting like they were never beginners. Not here. This ride is for those who have been pushed away by that culture‚Äîfor the road cycling-curious, the long-distance hopefuls, those on a health journey, for non-male riders, and anyone looking for a safe, ego-free space to learn and road ride.

Maybe you‚Äôre riding a vintage steel bike, a $10k dream build, or something you got secondhand. No matter what you ride, if you‚Äôre looking for an open and supportive cycling space, this is your ride.

What to Expect:

‚úÖ No egos. No bike shaming. No dumb questions.
‚úÖ A no-drop pace‚Äîeveryone stays together.
‚úÖ Seasoned riders to answer questions.
‚úÖ Social ride + space to learn road cycling basics.
‚úÖ Women, POC, non-binary, femme, lgbtq, cyclists encouraged to join.

üì£ Q&A can be asked privately to our seasoned riders or ask out loud! 

üö≤ All you need is a road bike, a helmet, and an open mind. Let‚Äôs build something together.

Tag a friend who‚Äôs been wanting to start cycling and let‚Äôs ride!

When she was little, Cienna Benn's mom taught her to stand barefoot in the grass outside their home in Altadena, California. Mom called it 'grounding,' a way to connect to her home, the land, and the multiple generations who came here before. Cienna's great-grandfather arrived in Altadena back in the 1930's, part of a larger migration that helped establish this small community in LA County as a haven for Black Americans.

But after the Eaton fire destroyed so much of this area last month, Black residents worry that developers will buy out the remaining multi-generational families who can't afford the long waits and the thicket of red-tape to rebuild what they've lost. 

The Benn's home was spared - the flames came right to their backyard, but no further. ""Divine intervention,"" says Cienna's dad. Their house was still infiltrated by smoke and other hazardous debris, and they can't move back in yet. 

Cienna says they'll never leave Altadena, because the connection to her family is too deep. ""I'm not interested in finding another [home]. I'm interested in growing everything that they planted here.""

Her story, and the story of other Black families in Altadena, will be coming soon on @newshour. Produced by my tremendous colleagues @mikewfritz and @lane_sam and filmed by @devinpinckard

Suddenly, everything made sense. The tightness in my chest. The way my body jolts awake at night, bracing for something that isn‚Äôt coming. The way even silence feels loud, heavy, unsettling. The way my mind feels foggy, like I‚Äôm moving through a world that no longer fits.

Grief and fear feel the same in the body. Both make you want to run, to fight, to brace yourself against something you can‚Äôt control.

But grief isn‚Äôt fear. Fear is about what might happen. Grief is about what already has. Fear screams escape. Grief whispers stay. Stay in the discomfort, in the longing, in the spaces they once filled.

And yet‚Äîgrief isn‚Äôt just an emptiness. It‚Äôs love, unspent. It‚Äôs proof that something, someone, mattered. And over time, it shifts. It doesn‚Äôt disappear, but it softens. It becomes something you carry, not something that carries you.

If you‚Äôre in it right now, just know this: You won‚Äôt always feel this way. Grief changes. And so will you.

Grateful to @taralipinski for sharing this C.S. Lewis quote. It‚Äôs incredible how words can find you exactly when you need them.

This was last night and I hadn‚Äôt been that far up in it like that at night.  It was pitch black, no lights, no people, no nada.  I felt so at home in that space, a safe space as the kids say, and didn‚Äôt want to leave.  The opportunity to drop these off gave me the idea to capture at night, in the peace, in the stillness, in the cool Altadena evening air that I love so much.  When you give in to your calling there is nothing left to fear. There is just the calling that you hear.  I love you Altadena.  I love your dreams.

Every day, I ache for my dear students and friends who lost everything. This disaster has left so many in limbo, uncertain about what the future holds.
Please know that it‚Äôs okay not to be okay. Give yourself grace, space to grieve, and permission to feel sadness. The road ahead will have dark moments, but we have to believe that light is waiting for us at the end of this long tunnel.
To all: I am here for you every step of the way. Please lean on me for support during this tough time.

Also, green lawns amidst complete fire devastation.  I was also struck by the randomness of it, entire blocks of houses burned to the ground and across the street a row of houses unharmed. The fireplaces remind me of gravestones. I am so saddened by this tragedy and I can‚Äôt imagine what it must be like for all the people that lost their houses.

I have been looking for new places to live for the last month. I was not able to afford anything on my own in the Los Angeles area. I had to get a bit creative, so I plan to move to the Las Vegas area on March 1st. I found a great 3-bedroom 2-bathroom Condo in the Centennial Hills area. It has everything I was looking for plus comes with a single car garage. It is about 30 minutes from the Strip. 

I am still actively looking for my kitten, Hoku, every day. I checked shelters and other sites in hopes we can find him. Animal rescuers have night cameras in the area and are also looking for him. I really hope we can find him and bring him home. I feel so much guilt about not being able to get to him in time with the fire.

As the Eaton Fire rapidly spread in early January, power outages throughout Southern California left many without electricity for days. Many were left without crucial appliances, and the lack of internet connection cut them off from the news.

Daniel, an Altadena resident, had a backup battery that kept his home powered for close to two days before the fire ultimately spread and damaged his system. During that period, he became the information center for his neighborhood, regularly providing important updates. This ultimately helped him and his neighbors to evacuate to safety.

The unfortunate truth is that extreme weather events, including fires and severe winds, will continue to affect Southern California. Having a backup battery to power your necessary appliances can quite literally be a lifesaver in these scenarios.

At Solar Discovery, we are committed to helping our local Southern California community through this difficult time. We are offering free site assessments for homeowners affected by the Eaton and Palisades Fires to evaluate damage to their solar systems and assist in the rebuilding process. If your home was affected, reach out to us to schedule an inspection and learn how you can restore your solar and battery systems as quickly as possible.

We can grieve for what is gone...but, we can still be happy and grateful for what is good in our lives too.

Undoubtedly, this last month has been emotionally heavy and difficult for so many. All of us who have friends that have lost their homes have had immense survivor‚Äôs guilt, and I‚Äôve mentally struggled and felt weird posting happy and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù content.

For this post though, it makes me feel really good that I was able to help my friend find a new home: a place of stability, a safe space to start their healing process. 

I hope that slowly, the sadness of losing the home that had been in their family for generations can turn into a sense of peace and be replaced with happy new memories as they rebuild.

They also said that there are gonna be about 100 crews for the eaton fire zone. Even with all of that I'm guessing it will take 8 to 12 months to clear the town.

Hopefully by this time tomorrow our back yard will be clear so we can start the pool clean up and permit process for garage replacement and interior cleaning! Yeah!

Nigerian-born musician and local business owner Onochie Chukwurah, describing what the Eaton fires did to his community of Altadena, CA. 

His store, Rhythyms of the Village, which he owned and operated with his son, Emeka, is a complete loss. In the aftermath, Onochie and Emeka and friends set up a donation center in his driveway, collecting and dispensing free goods for those who lost everything. ""This fire came here, devastated our community, [but] is turning us around too, from each one being mean to the other, to each one help[ing] the other. Everybody's helping.""

He and Emeka hope Altadena will return to the diverse community it was before, and resist the economic forces that might try to displace them. ""These are some resilient people,"" says Emeka. ""They've been here, for some people - a century, you know? And they and their family have placed these roots here, and I don't think it's going to be an easy battle for them to come and take it.""

So I was hesitant to post burn pics of my parents‚Äô house, since the damage is relatively minor. But seeing the garden I designed and help raise partially burnt to the ground is something else‚Ä¶

This is from the mud flows off tanoble on the east side. During our walk we spoke with a geologist who lived in the area . We spoke about the Eaton for around an hour and we are suppose to pick up our conversation soon but during our talk he mentioned. If we were to have another storm lasting 3 - 5 days of heavy rain there is a high likelihood of losing major portions of the mountain side .  Including buildings on the hill side as well below due to the effects of Eaton fire on the mountains above altadena. He was one of the you could say more fortunate individuals whos home was not lost to the Eaton ( heavy smoke damage) but would be lost if there were to be a lasting torrential down pour. #adirtydream #ADirtyDreammedia #apeshitinkphotography #ADevilsDreams #foosresponders #altadena #aftermath #eaton #eatonfire #wildfire,2025-02-23 01:18:04+00:00

The purpose of a post-fire real estate appraisal is to determine the exact pre and post-fire values of your property so you can make informed decisions. These values are needed for a variety of reasons. The reasons range from investment decisions, calculating an IRS casualty loss for your taxes, negotiating with your insurance adjuster, property tax appeal and evidence for a lawsuit. Below are just a few more reasons why you need a post-fire appraisal

Investment decisions to sell or rebuild
Pre listing market analysis
IRS casualty loss
Insurance settlement
Evidence for lawsuit
Property tax appeal
Short pay mortgage

The process begins with a physical inspection of the property to determine fire damage, specific location in the neighborhood and the view from the site. Some properties may only have interior smoke/ash damage, exterior soot staining, damage from heat while others are totally destroyed. Some damage can be remediated while other properties must be completely rebuilt.

He attended St. Elizabeth Parochial School through eighth grade and graduated from Pasadena High School.

His father, Jesus, made the decision to settle down in the area decades earlier, in around 1967. He purchased a house displaced by the construction of the Interstate 210 through Pasadena, and he moved the home to the family on North Marengo in Altadena.

The father-son duo rebuilt it, and this new home, replacing the smaller, older house on the land. It was bigger, grander and the center of countless family gatherings all these decades. That is, until Jan. 7.

On Saturday, we had the privilege of listening to the artists of Out of the Ashes as they shared their experiences of loss, resilience, and the long road ahead after the devastating Eaton and Palisades Fires.

The room was full‚Äîfull of grief, full of hope, full of artists who have lost lifetimes of work. Some lost their homes, their studios, their archives‚Äîeverything they had built. 40 artists, 40 stories. Not every artist had the chance to speak, but hands were raised solemnly throughout the audience signaling that their work is on display. The artists who spoke with Hannah offered deeply personal stories, recalling moments of profound devastation, and reflections on their identity as artists in the wake of unimaginable loss.

The feeling in the room was unlike anything we‚Äôve experienced before‚Äîan intense catharsis, a shared mourning, a collective attempt to process the unthinkable. 

It was a moment of deep connection in a week filled with high-energy openings and dazzling exhibitions across the city. In the midst of LA Art Week, this was a stopping point. A space for reflection. A moment that will stay with us forever.

Thank you to Craig Krull and Douglas Marshall for curating such a powerful, sensitive exhibition and for giving these artists a place to process, express, and find support in one another.

Most of all, thank you to the artists who bravely shared their stories‚Äîwe are in awe of your strength.

She is still slowly recovering in our ICU with treatment from our veterinary staff, but she is looking better every day. Her fur and whiskers are even starting to grow back and she continues to have the sweetest personality.

We are overjoyed to share that Hope‚Äôs family has been found. Hope, whose real name is Skinny Minnie, was a neighborhood cat in Altadena. Mark and Lisa had fallen in love with the outdoor kitty and decided to bring her into their family, working gradually to introduce her to their two indoor cats so she could live inside, too. Heartbreakingly, they had been so close to transitioning her to indoor life when the Eaton Fire tore through their neighborhood.

While Mark and Lisa were able to evacuate with their two indoor cats, Skinny Minnie was nowhere to be found. Severe winds pushed the fire into Altadena with little to no warning. As their home burned to the ground, they could only hope that Skinny Minnie had gotten herself to safety.

Mark and Lisa felt so many emotions when they were finally reunited with their beloved cat - including guilt for not being able to bring her inside sooner. However, no one could have predicted that such a terrible disaster would strike Altadena. Many were lucky to escape with their lives.

We look forward to the day when Skinny Minnie is able to finally go home with Mark and Lisa, who will be keeping her strictly indoors with their two other cats. Until then, these two loving cat parents are in our ICU every day, visiting with their sweet girl.

I have been stuck in what I am going to refer to as a trauma rut. I‚Äôve gone from anxiety to depression to anxiety, and I think the latest swing is back to a depressive state. I have been lucky in that my District has worked with me and allowed me the time I need to get myself to the place where I even want to come back to work. I have struggled with sleep, first, not getting enough, then wanting to sleep the whole day, as well as struggling with mustering up the mental and physical energy that I know I will need to support my students, their families, and school staff. 

thanks to some amazing human beings, I have been able to get my body, mind, and soul to a better place. 

let‚Äôs start with the amazing humans who have gifted their craft and their time: 
@waterpointwellness - thank you for the amazing cupping and acupuncture sessions
@thebody_drift - thank you for the gua sha facial and massage
@skinbycherokee - thank you for giving my face back it‚Äôs glow 

thank you to the ongoing bodywork by @holycitywellnesslmt 

and looking forward to therapy sessions with  @elliementalhealth 

@mzjuicyjones and I topped it all off with an amazing scrub and massage at Descanso spa. I feel like they scrubbed away all of the last two months, and a layer of skin lol

also, thank you to my amazing support system. I know the last few months of the school year are going to be nonstop and crazy and my support system is going to be greatly needed. 

Love to you all! take care of yourselves!

I went to search through the rubble a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised to find some of my pieces were still intact. 

Among the pieces I found was the first mug I ever made (last picture).

Ceramics wasn‚Äôt accessible to me growing up. I had the opportunity to take my first wheel throwing class during grad school at @berkeleyartstudio in 2022 through a scholarship. I have been at it ever since. Although the pieces I found are not safe to use, I am grateful that I still have a physical reminder of the progression of my pottery journey so far.

Her house was one of the first we drove to check on after confirming our house was gone. I cried for her beautiful piano, for Lady Gaga‚Äôs piano. We were just there 2 weeks prior for a piano recital. She had just rebranded to Altadena Piano School. It felt like the start of a new chapter. I had several dreams the first few weeks of Lady Gaga pulling Susie up to perform with her on stage. Maybe because of this article, that can happen.

The purpose of a post-fire real estate appraisal is to determine the exact pre and post-fire values of your property so you can make informed decisions. These values are needed for a variety of reasons. The reasons range from investment decisions, calculating an IRS casualty loss for your taxes, negotiating with your insurance adjuster, property tax appeal and evidence for a lawsuit. Below are just a few more reasons why you need a post-fire appraisal

* Investment decisions to sell or rebuild 
* Pre listing market analysis
* IRS casualty loss
* Insurance settlement
* Evidence for lawsuit
* Property tax appeal
* Short pay mortgage
* Buy out family member

The process begins with a physical inspection of the property to determine fire damage, specific location in the neighborhood and the view from the site. Some properties may only have interior smoke/ash damage, exterior soot staining, damage from heat while others are totally destroyed. Some damage can be remediated while other properties must be completely rebuilt. Prices start at $450 for an average sized home for pre-fire and post-fire values.

To everyone who has donated, shared, followed, and messaged‚Äî thank you from the bottom of our hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è

BUT WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP!

We‚Äôve learned so much in these last couple weeks ‚Äî and we have a lot more expenses than originally anticipated. By our calculations, the resources our new stretch goal will provide can get us up to four tile rescue crews (skilled masons) in the field and we can save well over 100 fireplaces here in the burn zone.

So what do we need to win the race against the bulldozers? Skilled masons, who are the heart and soul of our operation and are working long days with us to try to save every tile. They want to volunteer their own time, but they are small local businesses who have very real hard costs ‚Äî paying their skilled laborers, acquiring supplies such as scaffolding, tools, boxes, packing materials, and providing food and water and PPE to the tile removal teams. Just one fireplace takes a day or more to remove. It is painstaking, highly skilled work that cannot be rushed.

We could not do any of this without YOU. This town is knocked down hard but we are coming back strong. Please help us save every last tile!

These really are some of the worst natural disasters to ever befall the country. I know some of the reports were focusing a lens on the damage to e.g. luxury resorts but it's mostly working and middle class families and small businesses that are bearing the brunt of these calamities (especially in Altadena and across the Bluegrass State), and it's going to be many long and difficult years to recover. 

It's a pretty tough time for a lot of us right now but if you have the means and inclination, please take a moment to visit some of the donation aggregator sites like Charity Navigator, GiveWell or give dot org for some vetted and accredited organizations helping with the cleanup and recuperation efforts, and just helping the locals to get through things day by day. Every little bit helps.

The last time I had been there was the morning after the initial outbreak of the Eaton Fire. I spent most of that Wednesday preventing the fire from reaching my friend @scottgordonart ‚Äòs home. The houses behind his were already gone, and I did what I could to stop the flames creeping through his backyard.

I was curious to see the state of a town I had once frequented so often, but I also wanted to respect the devastation it had just endured. I didn‚Äôt want to photograph the remains of homes where families were now left with only chimneys and toxic swimming pools. But I did want to document the aftermath of the chaos that was the Eaton Fire.

After driving around, I came across what I assume was a used car lot‚Äîvehicles reduced to skeletal frames and corroded shells. Tires had melted into the ground, windows shattered, leaving behind jagged edges and warped blisters. The close-up shots revealed the textures of decay: flaking metal, charred paint, and the deep, corrosive wounds left by heat and time.

There was a heavy sadness while shooting these photos, a weight that settled with every frame. Standing among the wreckage, the sheer destruction was undeniable, forcing an acknowledgment of the chaos fire leaves behind. Each image holds the quiet devastation of loss, a reminder of how little survives when tragedy strikes. My heart goes out to those who lost their homes and belongings and to those now facing the immense struggle of having to start over.

Designed by the architect Gregory Ain and completed in 1948, from Dwell.com: ‚Äúthe Park Planned homes were forecast as ‚Äúminiature estates‚Äù, larger homes on more generous lots, but still incorporating the collective spirit, cost benefits of prefabrication, and design sensibilities that defined Ain‚Äôs pioneering work. With landscape architect Garrett Eckbo‚Äôs collaboration, the neighborhood feels like a park, with no front fences and continuous planting to unify the experience. Side-facing garages shelter individual homes from the street, and interior courtyards further buffer living spaces from public spaces, providing a sense of privacy within the larger community. While forward-looking and progressive, ahead of its time, the architecture is at once elemental and timeless: rooted in the earth, with walls of glass facing private gardens, responsive to the climate, with clerestory windows and skylights bringing natural light and cross-ventilation to the interior of every room.‚Äù Been messing around in real estate development for a few years now and this is exactly the kind of work that drew me to it in the first place. I aim to build, renovate and develop places that connect people and create the same tight-knit bonds as Ain‚Äôs homes. #design #eatonfire #light #space #pasadena #altadena #architecture",2025-02-26 04:09:26+00:00

Back in 2021, as you can see by the masks, I was walking in Altadena and stopped to gaze at this charming Cape Cod home. These ladies were chatting in front, so happy to connect, and so open and friendly with me and my friend.  The owner of this home, and I believe it was the woman on the left, told me a bit about her achievement of purchasing it, and she really took pride in it. 

You can see how everything was pristine, the lawn, the landscaping, the sweet statue in the front‚Ä¶ So this is one of the ones that hit hardest when it comes to the recent fire. This house was among the casualties.

I would like to talk to her again. If anyone knows either of these people, please private message me so that I can connect with them and see how they're doing. 

I tried several times to post this and I just could not do it, it hurts my heart. I apologize if it hurts yours, too, but as you know, I feel it's important to tell these stories.

I am so thankful to have helped my client sell their fire-impacted lot. They were planning on selling their home later this year, but due to the horrific events of early January they had little choice but to sell their fire-impacted vacant parcel as soon as practical. Prior to the fire their property was likely worth around $1.8M-$1.9M, we sold their land today for $603,077, or about $64 per SF. Despite the challenges and stress my client faced they were able to proceed with their goal of relocating out of state, closing escrow in a few weeks on their new home. Thank you for trusting me with your transaction and I wish you a comfortable and optimistic next step. Thank you!

Batchelder, a pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement, began producing hand-crafted tiles in 1910. Inspired by Southern California's booming construction industry and the region's embrace of Arts and Crafts aesthetics, he built a kiln behind his bungalow on the banks of the Arroyo Seco. Initially, Batchelder's tiles were made using this portable kiln with a capacity for just 150 tiles per firing. His early designs drew on medieval, Renaissance, and Art Nouveau themes, often featuring intricate low-relief patterns with muted earth tones and blue accents achieved through a single-fire engobe process. 

These tiles are priceless to the homeowners and to the preservation of art. Thats why! 

Please help us save as many tiles as we can üôå

By Wednesday morning, #Pasadena was a different place. The #EatonFire had taken hold, the air thick with smoke, and evacuation orders loomed. Before I evacuated my home and closed the shop for the day, I made one last stop at our kitchen to pick up the cookies and deliver them to @verwright .

But as the fires spread and the air quality worsened, she made the difficult but responsible decision to cancel the event‚Äîwhile many of her clients were already mid-flight to Pasadena. A surreal moment‚Äîmonths of planning disrupted in an instant. But in true Val Wright fashion, she found a way to turn the loss into something meaningful.

Instead of letting the cookies go to waste, she donated them to her daughters‚Äô school, where 76 families lost their homes in the #EatonFire. But she didn‚Äôt stop there. Val took action to support those affected, assisting families by gathering essential supplies and even opening her home to a displaced family.

Our hearts are with all the families impacted, and we‚Äôre grateful that everyone is safe. Pasadena is our home, and like Val, we believe in community first.

So when I recently saw the massive destruction of homes in my childhood town of Pacific Palisades, I felt possessed by the idea of giving some of these vanished houses a second life on canvas. I was so very lucky to find @ashley_miller__ and @amybeemerlev, two visionary women who organized a database of homes, their former owners, and artists who had the same impulse that I did. They are @homesinmemoriam on Instagram.

A Los Angeles Times reporter, Jessie Schiewe @jessiewritesgood found us and sent the amazing photographer @emilravelo to take pictures.

Today it took me from tremors in my bowels and numb forearms to a feeling near elation as I set foot in my parents' home of 37 years - my childhood home - for the first time since the Eaton fire. 

The destruction is so complete that in these 7+ weeks of speaking about it, words have yet to really encompass the scale of what's happened in Altadena. Because I've already experienced the failure of words in this regard, I had no expectation that today's photo session would adequately document the loss of even this one house. And it was for that reason that I went with Polaroid.

The other reason I chose the Polaroid is that exactly three months ago (it's beyond incredible that it was that recent) I brought along this same SLR 680 - though with a couple packs of B&W instead of color - to photograph our family Thanksgiving. Sadly, a number of the photos from that set were lost in the fire. But the remaining ones I brought with me up to the house today.

So within this post there are two different sets of Polaroids taken at my parents' Altadena home: the B&W set is from this past Thanksgiving, Nov 28, 2024; the color set is from February 27, 2025 and is my contribution to #12monthsonfilmfeb

It would be impossible to know this without me saying it - but today's color photos (specifically Pics 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) were taken from the exact spot as their counterparts from the Thanksgiving set (or as nearly as I could approximate it standing as I was in the crawl space, three feet lower than the non-existent floor).

At the beginning of this post I used the word ""elated"" and I meant it. I don't understand it, and I for sure wasn't expecting this (I'd been dreading this day since the house was destroyed), but I actually found this visit cathartic. I won't say healing - that is going to take a lot more time. But it did do something to improve my holding of this whole catastrophe, at least insofar as it has directly impacted my family. It was also very meaningful to have two close friends with me, for the experience and the support @apc_ortes @sailingdelilah üôèüèº

The Harley you are looking at was his father‚Äôs, a father he never was able to meet as he was just three months in his mother‚Äôs belly when he passed.  Sean lived with his mother and sister in the house that burned, a home passed down by his grandmother.  I talked with Sean for a long time, he spent a good portion of it talking about her generosity to the grandkids and grandchildren.  Grandmothers are Gods greatest gifts to us all. The blessings they give and pass on know no end.  Sean needs help getting this bike out of its location and would like the frame restored and painted to the original color that his dad had so he can keep that memory close to him and his family.

In the wake of the Eaton fire, we were honored to assemble and deliver 850 backpacks filled with school supplies and Chromebooks across nine locations in Altadena and Pasadena to provide some relief and support students as they resume their studies. 

Shout-out to @pasadena.rosebud, @saint_marks_school_altadena, @harambeeministries After School in Pasadena, @altadenaelementary, @eliotartsmagnet, the @ymcaofwsgv (3 locations), and the @bgcpasadena for helping to make this happen!

Thank you to @kcalnews for highlighting ways that others in the community can still get involved during the clean-up and rebuilding process.

At about 4:15 am ish there abouts. I was driving up lake from poppy fields . When I hit wapello there was a smoke wall you could not see past. Each time the wind blew you would see this bright orange glow in the complete darkness. Then smoke would blind you n seconds later we would be battered with embers and debris . I flipped a u turn in front of this House... I remember seeing flames billowing huge flames from the front window before being pelted with more debris that sounded like if we were hit with buck shot. I think that's when we went from property preservation to life cause thats we did we started saving sleeping neighbors...

From their site:
‚ÄúWe are a volunteer army of residents, preservationists, and heritage organizations in a race against time to help owners rescue their treasured original craftsman tiles from homes destroyed by the wildfires. We remove, preserve and store the tiles at no cost to the homeowners.""

I love tile and applaud their efforts and want to do whatever I can to support them.  And by the way, I want to thank everyone who brought them to my attention - that was very thoughtful of you!

I met with Stanley Zucker, one of the TOP DOGS of the group, with his four-footed assistant/cohort/companion, Peggy!  They were kind enough to welcome me onto one of their sites to check them out in action. 

Unfortunately, when I arrived, they had already removed most of the tiles they were preserving, but I could see it‚Äôs a top-notch operation.  They‚Äôre engaging very skilled workers to do the removal carefully, and packaging the tiles and even storing them for the homeowners until such time as they have a place to put them.  And all this is done free of charge for those who lost these homes.  WHAT A GIFT!

I am personally grateful to them for all they‚Äôre doing to preserve these important parts of our artistic history.

Though many of the fireplaces of the region are decorated with the famous Batchelder tiles (no room to go into them here, but you can read up on him and his work on the Save The Tiles site), there were other pottery houses  which also created these classic rustic tiles, often incorporating nature motifs in their work. 

Scroll to see not only the home of Batchelder himself (which is private), but many examples of his tiles and others of the era. 

You can contact and donate to Save The Tiles through their site, or through me. 

Also, please remember my own Chimney project.  Sign-up link in bio and the best birthday present to me would be for each of you to please tell two friends (at least) so that I may help as many people as possible.

With gratitude as always‚Ä¶. Janet",2025-03-01 13:54:52+00:00

 But here and there, little things remain‚Äîa hoop with no basketball, a swing with no child to laugh on it, a washing machine with no laundry to clean, chairs with no one to sit, an elevator with no place to go.

All that remains are ghosts of a life that existed before the fire.

Approximately 5500 homes were lost in the Palisades in January, in an area larger than the size of Manhattan.

Approximately 9000 homes were lost in Altadena.

This is one of the last if not the very last surviving wood A-Frame house in Altadena that looks exactly how it did when it was built in 1924 by famous author, Kyle Onstott. Kyle was also a competition dog trainer. Prior to the construction of these houses the lot was used as his dog kennel. Outside of the four house houses subdivided on his lot, nearly every other house in the area was destroyed. This house is significant because it sits dead center in the historically Black area of Altadena and represents what many of the houses looked like at its peak.

Life is full of thresholds‚Äîplaces where the old fades, but the new hasn‚Äôt yet come into focus. It‚Äôs in these moments‚Äîafter certainty unravels but before clarity arrives‚Äîthat we must decide: Will we cling to what was, or make room for what‚Äôs next?

The Refocus was born from that space. Not just to help us navigate change, but to emerge from it awake, attuned, and anchored in something more true.

Because resilience isn‚Äôt about pushing through at all costs‚Äîit‚Äôs about knowing when to soften, when to surrender, when to rebuild. Focus isn‚Äôt about productivity‚Äîit‚Äôs about presence. Growth isn‚Äôt a finish line‚Äîit‚Äôs a practice.

That‚Äôs what this space is for.
‚Ä®For those still finding their footing.‚Ä®For those holding both grief and hope in the same breath.‚Ä®For those ready to cut through the noise and return to what truly matters.

Inside, you‚Äôll find:‚Ä®‚ú® Guided meditations to help you steady yourself in uncertainty.‚Ä®‚ú® Downloadable resources to support you in processing, refocusing, and reclaiming what matters.‚Ä®‚ú® Articles that don‚Äôt just offer answers, but also the right questions.‚Ä®‚ú® A place where you don‚Äôt have to force healing‚Äîonly allow space for it to unfold.

This is more than a resource‚Äîit‚Äôs a recalibration. A way to step back, cut through the noise, and return to yourself.

And this is not just an offering. It‚Äôs my commitment.‚Ä®To meet you in the in-between.
‚Ä®To stand with you as you refocus, realign, and step into what‚Äôs next.

So take what you need. Stay as long as you want. The door is open.

We begin here.

We carried materials that will help stop erosion and worked on rebuilding the trail in some damaged areas.  The trail is in good shape but is still very vulnerable and will surely have some significant damage if we get some heavy rains. We got about 7/10 of a mile short of Orchard Camp. Hopefully, the work that has been done will help minimize the damage. The debris basin in the canyon had a lot of material in it but there was a long line of trucks waiting to carry the debris away. #mountwilsontrail #trailwork #eatonfire",2025-03-03 02:46:24+00:00

And then to look in the rear view to see that they have always been taken from, and then still stare at the moon?  But for Tyreke and the Jackson‚Äôs, you can take the lot, you can take the cars, you can break the chains and take some more, but you can‚Äôt take their faith in God and the goodness in their fellow man. Because when times get tough, they stare at His Son.  God is good, even in the worst of times. And you can not take that away from them.  No sir.  Now are you going to stare at the moon or are you going to look at what is right here in Altadena, California?  This is for the Jackson‚Äôs. For Altadena.  I love you Altadena.  I love your dream.

We have well over 100 and the list is still growing!

What have we learned so far? We‚Äôll publish preliminary data very soon, but here‚Äôs the answer to the question above from our soil scientist:
 
‚ÄúEvery home should know it‚Äôs lead number.‚Äù 
TEST!! üí©
Lead is an indicator for a host of other contaminants.
Your soil science doesn‚Äôt lie. üß´üî¨
If not safe‚Ä¶ call a professional in.

Burn zone: test and retest after ALL of your neighbors scrape (üí®they‚Äôll dust you, and 1/3 come up above EPA warning levels post scrape for this reason). 

IF your soil tests in multiple locations are well below EPA warning levels, do you need to grow anything or remediate your soil? 
No.

Should you add biochar and other amendments?
We do, but organic compost is truly the queen of all remediation and soil health.
üìùNote: We tested every single California available soil and compost in our commercial greenhouse, and one out of all of them repeatedly produced plants that were so much taller and healthier than every other, we no longer had to even look at the tags: @malibucompost @number2organics
You can find it  @aquaflosupply 
Neither of them asked nor paid me a cent to say this.

Where can you test?
Comment ‚ÄúSoil Test‚Äù and I‚Äôll message you a list!

This was Kevin‚Äôs mother‚Äôs 57 Chevy. She was a real estate agent, saw it at a property one day, bought it because she liked it. I love that. Life is short and she acted accordingly. I had a mother like that also, she did a lot of things like that right before she passed.  She bought a Model T and moved to Georgia, went back to where she came from, then passed. It didn‚Äôt make much sense to me until I went back there to see her place and saw the car parked against all that Georgia summer green.  When I met Kevin, saw his mother‚Äôs car, and heard his story, all I could see was that car in perfect shape, against a spring backdrop of our beautiful Altadena, California.  Kevin, I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for all the time we have spent together.  I sincerely appreciate you more than you will ever know. See you soon. I love you Altadena.  I love your dream.

Thank you, Josie for gifting me this adorable fabric.  Cut out in my FEMA hotel and made at @sewinglablosalamitos on their @janome_sewing machines. ‚ÄúOld vines‚Äù snaps from my mother‚Äôs sewing stash.

(Ps.  I took these photos on a glorious sunny day which turned dark and stormy and I evacuated again from the #eatonfire zone due to threat of flood and debris flow.  It‚Äôs been an adventure for sure).

I was lucky enough to test this classic style.  This is an earlier version in testing. It later got refined to be a bit more fitted. But I‚Äôve been waiting for a good Henley pattern and as usual, #greenstylepatterns has lots of options including crew neck, scoop neck, placket, no placket, different sleeve lengths, cuffs and #fba.  I think their patterns are so good and a good value too.  Check out the hashtag for lots of great tester examples (using the final version of the pattern) and chances to win the pattern. 

Worn with #gsbillieshorts by #greenstylecreations. Details in a previous post.

I see the resilient nature in Altadena, rising out of the ashes like nothing happened. I remain hopeful that the neighbors who tended to it so carefully will rise up again as well. I also see too many reasons and signs for why this road will be full of obstacles and frankly not one that everyone should take. Are resilient people allowed to feel worried and disheartened?

Originally written by Courtney Love and Billy Corgan, first performed by Hole, Pacific Coast Highway was Courtney‚Äôs ode to loss‚Äîmissing someone who could never return. But for me, it speaks to something different: chasing someone who will never understand me, who can‚Äôt reciprocate.

I was in the Palisades Fire when it tore through the hills, surrounded by chaos, watching the world burn. But even then, I heard the voice of God on the Pacific Coast Highway‚Äîand that was enough to curb any loneliness I might have felt.

This song is about longing, surrender, and finding solace where you least expect it. My share of the royalties is going straight to the Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods. Hope you hear something in it too.

If everyone tells just two friends that they know who lost their home, I will be able to help so many more people. This is a free service that I am offering to Altadena residents  who lost everything. 

I'm in Altadena for the next several days, so if you're going to be there and would like me to take pictures of a certain site, or know someone who would appreciate that, please reach out!

At first look into the destruction of our towns, it‚Äôs hard to see past the brutality of the fires. But there is this. The more you lean in, and if stare a little longer, and if you talk to everyone you see, you begin to notice the divine beauty in all of it. I know the images are hard to look at and can bring sadness to you. But, if you were afforded the opportunity like I have been, to stare patiently into the melted glass, you would start to see something different. 
A photo of the moon, no matter how large or brilliant, cannot change the tide. You have to be the moon. So, with your help, I am going to bring the moon to you, so that, in turn, you may become the moon as well. Because when something so brilliant and bright such as this shines in your face, illuminated by the Son, you become what you are looking at and looking for. And then you can change the tide.
This is not a story of destroyed cars, homes and the sadness that this tragedy brings. This is a story of resilience in the face of immense adversity. A story of a community, that when challenged with the impossible, thrives like none other. This is a story of love and compassion for your fellow man. This story is told through the cars we love and the people that love them. I love you Altadena.  I also love you Pacific Palisades.  Love everyone.  I love your dream.

üö® NOTICIA DE √öLTIMA HORA: El Condado de Los √Ångeles Demanda a SoCal Edison por el Incendio Eaton üö®

El Condado de Los √Ångeles ha presentado una demanda contra Southern California Edison (SCE) y Edison International para recuperar los costos masivos causados por el Incendio Eaton, que arras√≥ 14,000+ acres, destruy√≥ 9,400 estructuras, y cobr√≥ 17 vidas.

üî• ¬øQu√© dice la demanda?

El incendio comenz√≥ debajo de l√≠neas de transmisi√≥n de SCE en Eaton Canyon.
SCE report√≥ una ""falla"" en su l√≠nea de transmisi√≥n en el momento del incendio.
Se encontr√≥ evidencia de arcos el√©ctricos y da√±os en el equipo de conexi√≥n a tierra de SCE.
üí∞ ¬øPor qu√© es importante?
El condado busca cientos de millones de d√≥lares para cubrir:
‚úîÔ∏è Infraestructura p√∫blica, parques y senderos destruidos
‚úîÔ∏è Esfuerzos de limpieza y recuperaci√≥n
‚úîÔ∏è Prevenci√≥n de inundaciones y deslizamientos de tierra
‚úîÔ∏è P√©rdida de ingresos fiscales y da√±os econ√≥micos
‚úîÔ∏è Horas extra para los socorristas de emergencia

üìç La demanda, presentada en la Corte Superior de Los √Ångeles, busca garantizar que la comunidad de Altadena reciba los recursos necesarios para reconstruir. Las ciudades de Pasadena y Sierra Madre tambi√©n han presentado demandas contra SCE.

What did you lose?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄùTwo boats.‚Äù I said,‚Äù I now also shoot burned boats.‚Äù Junior told me about the night of the fire, how hard him and his wife fought, came back multiple times, until they absolutely had to leave.  Shit was crazy up there. His street only has one way out and with a heart full of God he left, and thank goodness, because a tree fell and blocked the street shortly after.  They would have been caught behind the enemies line. Not good. His son knows what that means more the me though. I‚Äôm just an a lucky neighbor, an observer, a guy with a home, a car, and all that jazz. Semper Fi, Eric. They fought so hard, for you, for your sister, for the family, for the place they raised you in. Your mom and dad are hard af. I watched that video your dad made of your graduation right when he sent it me. Thank you for your service. 
When you get stuck up delta, with one way out, you make your way by going as hard as you possibly can to get to safety and you fight like hell to get there. The proceeds of your parents victory was their lives. Although they couldn‚Äôt save the home, they saved themselves to keeping raising you and your sister and God willing, to spoil their grandchildren one day.  It‚Äôs an honor to have met you Junior.  You‚Äôre the real deal and you take amazing photos. Thank you for letting me tell your story.  I will see you soon. For the Rodriguez family.  For Altadena.  I love you Altadena.  I love your dream.

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhy would anyone build in these areas in the first place?‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúShould we really rebuild here?‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúMaybe this is a sign that people shouldn‚Äôt live there at all.‚Äù

Much of it was written by people who don‚Äôt live in Los Angeles and don‚Äôt understand its geography. The reality is that Los Angeles is a city defined by nature‚Äîmountains surround it, mountains cut through it, mountains shape it. Nearly every part of Los Angeles brushes up against wild, drought-prone, flammable terrain. That‚Äôs simply the nature of the place we call home.

Telling people not to rebuild isn‚Äôt just impractical‚Äîit ignores the reality of Los Angeles. The question isn‚Äôt whether we rebuild, but how. 

Head over to my blog to read my thoughts on how we can rebuild smarter in a smarter, more resilient Los Angeles.

A city burning down smells a lot different than a forest burning down.‚Äù At the incident, he partnered with CAL FIRE captains to guide his Corpsmembers. Working 24-hour shifts, they created fire line, protected structures, and filled thousands of sandbags to combat post-fire flooding and mudslides. ‚ÄúI think this was an incredible experience not just for myself, but for my crew as well,‚Äù Ben said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so motivating to see these young adults come together with a common mindset and achieve the task at hand, no matter the obstacles in front of them.‚Äù

When it comes to fire-resistant, earthquake-proof, and seriously sustainable housing, SuperAdobes might just be the game-changer L.A. needs. üåû

Developed by architect Nader Khalili, this revolutionary technique uses earth-filled sandbags, barbed wire, and on-site materials to create homes that can withstand extreme fires and seismic activity‚Äîand still look absolutely stunning. ‚òÅÔ∏è

For those facing the devastating task of rebuilding after the Pacific Palisades and Eaton fires, this could be an opportunity to reimagine what‚Äôs possible. 

A home that‚Äôs not just a structure, but a fortress working with the elements and surrounding environment‚Äîand one that‚Äôs shockingly simple to build.

Now, I am launching the Altadena Resilient Rebuild‚Äîa collective effort designed to help the entire neighborhood recover faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost.

Through California Home Designs, I‚Äôve partnered with my builder to streamline the rebuild of up to 300 homes, creating semi-custom, high-quality homes that integrate fire-resistant materials, modern construction, and sustainable design‚Äîexceeding California‚Äôs latest wildfire and building standards.

With 20 years of experience in housing, design, and urban planning, I‚Äôve worked to create stronger, more livable communities. I recently became Wildfire Defense Certified with CAL FIRE & USGBC-CA, further strengthening my ability to support resilient rebuilding efforts. Now, I am applying that knowledge to help homeowners rebuild smarter and safer‚Äîstarting in Altadena, a community in Los Angeles County with modest lots and compact homes.

Rebuilding as a unified community offers key benefits:
‚úÖ Lower costs ‚Äì Bulk purchasing reduces material and labor expenses.
‚úÖ Faster timelines ‚Äì Coordinated permitting and construction accelerate rebuilding.
‚úÖ Wildfire resilience ‚Äì Strengthening homes together improves neighborhood safety.
‚úÖ More housing ‚Äì ADUs expand living space and housing options

I‚Äôve explained that the workers will take a long time to clean the rubble from the Eaton fire and build a new home, but he keeps asking every day after I pick him up from school because he really wants to believe that maybe I am wrong and our home is ready.

He also insists on going to the McDonald‚Äôs by our old home. Yesterday, he even told the drive-through worker that he was sorry about their sign being burned, which really touched the guy. Today, I reached my limit with Henry asking to see if his house is ready, wanting to check with his own eyes, so I agreed to take him. He asked me to call the builders to come quickly because he doesn‚Äôt want to be in a ‚Äúborrowed home‚Äù; he wants to return to his house. He wants to be in a home that is ours. ü•π

I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs two months today since the Eaton fire ripped through and took out our neighborhood. We are officially back in our house after a lengthy remediation process to fix the smoke and ash damage and replace a lot of our contents. We‚Äôre so grateful to be home but it‚Äôs also impossible not to heavily feel for the many many thousands whose houses were lost and can‚Äôt go back, as well as a huge number of people whose houses are miraculously standing, but they can‚Äôt live amongst the burnt out toxic destruction. So, people are still bouncing among air bnbs and friends houses. 

With that many people displaced, it‚Äôs created a crazy situation with finding housing. Coming back to the house was our 8th move since the fire. 

My studio got ‚Äòcleaned‚Äô but not sufficiently so I‚Äôve started pulling everything out‚Ä¶ which has led to finding drywall issues etc that I may as well fix now. It‚Äôs one of those things - once you pull the string on it, you have to just keep going! üí™üòÇ The third and fourth pic in the carousel show the current state! But it will be great once it‚Äôs all done. I‚Äôm thinking I will redo the floors also seeing as I have to take everything out anyway. Pink glitter floors?!? üíï 

So stay tuned for a bit of a makeover. I‚Äôm gunna make some silver (glitter!) linings to all of this. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®üåà

It‚Äôs something we learn to hold.‚Å†
‚Å†
Lately, I‚Äôve been reminded just how heavy it can be‚Äînot just the loss itself, but the exhaustion of carrying something that has nowhere to go. The way it lingers in the body, in the unexpected moments, in the spaces where the world expects us to move on.‚Å†
‚Å†
But grief isn‚Äôt about getting over it. It‚Äôs about making space for it. About finding ways to hold the love, the ache, the memories‚Äîwithout letting them drown us.‚Å†
‚Å†
This week‚Äôs blog post dives into how we do that. How we stop trying to erase what hurts, how we create rituals of remembrance, how we trust that grief will change‚Äîeven when it feels impossible.‚Å†

Fences make better neighbors? Huh, really? Why‚Äôs that when the fences all burned down I finally saw all the beautiful people of Altadena? Had the fences not been dropped I would never had met Rodney.  I take my kids to get ice cream, he cuts next store.  Never met him. I‚Äôll see if we can get a window installed from shop to shop so we can finally see each other.  They have candy in there as well, I‚Äôve slept on that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Not anymore. Rodney hit me up early, but he‚Äôs hard to catch, he‚Äôs busy, he‚Äôs got a list of clients, a family to take care of. He‚Äôs a good man. When we finally met at his spot, he said he wanted to know what I was up to, the why and where of it all. I was honest, told him a few reasons, the injustice of the fire and how unfair it all feels. I also told him I‚Äôm out here working on my own issues, my own bullshit. I believe the people, the photos and the stories will take this someplace on its own. I write the copy not the destiny, God does, I just need to show up as a helper. Rodney‚Äôs family lost a whole list of classic trucks and a Harley.  This is just one of them, they just bought it a few weeks before the fire ate it.  I hate that fire, more and more each day.  Rodney had a legendary barber shop in the back up of the house, you know if you know, I didn‚Äôt because of the fences so he showed me a photo. Amazing.  He just finished a bike for his son, legit, fire ate that also.  See, why I hate the fire a little more each day?  But, but, but without those fences you see, you get to make more connections each day, more friends each day, friends like Rodney who I will work hard to not let down. But you need to show up to do that.  So show up.  See you at the car thing. I love you Altadena.  I love your dream.

The truck featured is a 1951 Chevy 3100. Fully restored. 235. Stick shift.

I hope and pray I did you proper in my photos and words, and continue to do right by you as we rebuild Altadena and it‚Äôs beautiful car culture together.  I‚Äôd like to thank my amazing wife, who has put up with a lot of me lately. All that energy I put into this gets unwound when I get home. She‚Äôs seen a lot as well, maybe not the burned down homes and cars like me, but the mirror of them in me. It‚Äôs a whole lot to feel what I feel everyday, see what I see everyday. I can transmute that into work energy the best I can, but I‚Äôm human, and we humans make some mistakes. I‚Äôm grateful for being told when I make them, so I can change, be a better husband, father, and neighbor. Thank you @keniarts7 for your wisdom. I needed that.

Since the California wildfires, I‚Äôve been navigating a lot of uncertainty about my small business and slowly processing what‚Äôs happened over the past two months. I felt uneasy when the pop-up events were postponed, as they have significantly contributed to supporting my business. I tried to figure out quick solutions to see how to pay bills, but I also had a deep desire to contribute to the community. As things have started to improve financially, I feel like it‚Äôs the right time to give back. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to witness what was built over time and lost so suddenly by forces beyond our control. Like these uncertain times, it reminded me of Covid, in which the essence of Mindful Cements began when I found peace in creating something new‚Äîalmost as a mindful practice and a way to cope with what was happening. Mindful Cements allowed me to step back into my world and create freely, without overthinking. I hope to bring a sense of calm and ease to your space with the pieces I create. So, I‚Äôm offering free (yes new) home goods and a 35% discount for victims to help them rebuild what was lost and hope it can help towards their healing üíùüè°

530,steinwayandsons,grandpiano,eatonfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DG9PNEwyv9F/,575348023,Valley Village,"Today we moved my family‚Äôs 111-year-old Steinway & Sons grand piano to my house. This was the piano that I learned to play on when I was growing up. My dad grew up with it too ‚Äì my grandmother Esther used to teach piano in their old house in the Hollywood Hills. Back then, the Steinway was facing a Mason & Hamlin grand, so she could play four-hand duets with her students. After Esther died, the piano accompanied my parents to their house in Silver Lake, and three different homes in Altadena over a four-decade span. You can hear this piano on the lone jazz album my dad recorded as a leader, ca. 2000.

I always knew that this piano would be my inheritance, but I couldn‚Äôt have predicted that it would be sitting in my living room while my parents were still very much alive and well, still able to play. We have the Eaton Fire to thank for that. This piano‚Äôs arrival is one of the very few positives to come out of this horrible ordeal.

I have so many mixed feelings about this. On one hand, this is the finest thing I will ever own. It‚Äôs already a joy to play, even before it has acclimated to its new surroundings, even before I‚Äôve had it tuned. There‚Äôs a depth of sound, a dynamic range, and a sensitivity to touch that I forgot was possible in a piano. It has held up incredibly well despite its century-plus age. 

On the other hand it‚Äôs now my job to steward this family heirloom with the same care that my dad did, and his mom did before him. I don‚Äôt want to be the last generation of Rosenbloom to love this piano and discover the love of making music on this piano. That‚Äôs a huge responsibility that‚Äôs already weighing on me.

But I have a feeling this is all just first-day jitters. Once we clear some furniture out of the way and find a new home for the Kawai upright that has served me so well for the past decade, the Steinway will feel like it belongs. Like it has always belonged.

I took this opportunity to talk to Rep. Chu to briefly stress how difficult it is to operate a small business especially now in wake of the Eaton Fire. More than 90,000 people have been displaced since the fire, and so many of us lost a substantial customer base. There has been little relief to those of us still standing.

If you love a neighborhood small business, even if it‚Äôs not in Sierra Madre, please support them whenever possible.

As we rebuild, countless families are still without permanent housing. Fortunately, many organizations are stepping up to help those in need. United Way has partnered with our brewery, @smogcitybeer, as part of Smog‚Äôs 1% for the Planet series to support wildfire relief efforts.

One way you can help is by picking up We Love LA, our delicious West Coast IPA bursting with tropical fruit aromas and a hint of peach ring sweetness.

You've already met our first participant, Nicole, and here are several others that I've had the great pleasure of photographing in the last couple of weeks. They are all such lovely people with amazing attitudes and tons of hope for the future. 

I'll be focusing on them individually in future posts but for now I wanted you to meet a few of them all together. 

Here you see, in order of appearance, Brenda and her daughter, Ivy, The Alvarados, Emma & Emmanuel, with their grandson, Tony, and Toni & Patrick, Jocelyn, and Vito!

They have all lost their homes and pretty much everything they owned, precious collections, priceless treasured items, yet they smile so brightly. It really has been such a special experience to meet and photograph them.

In the case of The Alvarados, I was too late‚Ä¶ Their property has already been completely cleared! It's a reminder that this is really important because one day, the evidence of their past is there, the next, it's gone! 

I hope you'll help me to help more people by telling a friend or two. 

More information and the sign up are in the link in the bio or I can send it to you directly if you DM me.

Here's to a bright and beautiful future for Altadena! With such wonderful residents, it will surely rise from the ashes and be incredibly beautiful and wonderful again. 

And thanks so much to everyone here for being so patient with me while I gather together all the photos for you. With communicating about the project, running around taking pictures, editing and organizing the photos and keeping up with posts, besides the other parts of my life, it's tricky to keep up right now. üòâ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÖ

So where do we put our sorrow when there‚Äôs no place for it to land? How do we carry what‚Äôs gone when we‚Äôre told to just move forward? If loss feels heavier now, maybe it‚Äôs because we were never meant to carry it in silence.

This award isn‚Äôt just about me‚Äîit‚Äôs about the power of community and the people who make change happen together.

I didn‚Äôt grow up with much, moving from home to home‚Äîespecially within District 49‚Äîbefore my family found stability through luck and my parents‚Äô hard work. My mother always taught me: ‚ÄúPut yourself in other people‚Äôs shoes‚Äù (no pun intended), and I‚Äôve lived by that mantra ever since.

No one accomplishes anything alone. 

This recognition reflects the efforts of over 200 volunteers‚Äîmany of them teenagers (our future)‚Äîwho showed up with open hearts, ready to serve over 1000 families the past few months. From spreading awareness to donating essentials alongside our shoes, their generosity and kindness were overwhelming.

A special thank you to Assemblymember Mike Fong for this honor and for his commitment to uplifting our community. His leadership is a reminder that change happens when people step up for each other. Thank you also for the special experience to witness and be a part of the vote to commemorate and celebrate Women‚Äôs History Month.

This experience reinforced what I already knew: community is everything. My hope is that we continue to look out for one another, lend a hand when needed, and lead with both wisdom and compassion.

From the bottom of my heart‚Äîthank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

The next few posts you‚Äôll see come from one collection of 268 photographs, dozens of negatives, and notebooks found by @jesspantaleon. Jess was volunteering at the Pasadena Convention Center shortly after evacuation, and she found these photos scattered in some shrubs by the parking lot entrance for the Paseo. 

These photos capture a family over the course of several years, from 1979 to 1985. We believe the men pictured here are brothers. They were likely in their late twenties / early thirties at the time these photos were taken, meaning that they‚Äôre likely in their sixties or seventies now. 

Based on the state of these items when they were found (see last photo), we believe that the owner evacuated to the convention center in the early aftermath of the fire, parked at the Paseo, and dropped these items as they were heading across the street. 

Here‚Äôs what we know about the owner based on what‚Äôs in this collection: they‚Äôre an electrician; they had a grey pet cat in the 1980s; they traveled to Massachusetts in autumn 1979; they hiked Havasupai in October 1983; one of the brothers was married around 1985; the groom or the bride was most likely Jewish; also in 1985 they went to the LA Zoo and The Huntington (with a woman who appears to be their mother).

All photos appear to have been taken in the Pasadena / Glendale / Burbank area.

With strong Santa Ana winds, and dry brush/tress as fuel, the fires devastated everything in it's path almost eliminating entire historic and beautiful towns off the map such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena.
I used to live in Atadena...where Family of mine also lost their entire home. This first picture shows what used to be the house.
As I was pulling into Altadena, I wasn't fully sure what to expect and as I was going around a curve, it turned from a beautiful neighborhood, to an apocalyptic scene. It's hard to drive around and realize that many people lost everything. All their memories, belongings, their home, cars, everything. And some don't have places to stay now, let alone, in the foreseeable future until things can be rebuilt.
But LA is strong and the people resilient. Things will be rebuilt, but it'll never be the same.

I just thought I'd share this with people who maybe haven't seen or as a reminder that there are people out there who still need help and resources to get through this. If you can help in any way, do so. It doesn't go unnoticed. Thanks for taking a moment to read this.

These photos come from one collection of 268 photographs, dozens of negatives, and notebooks found by @jesspantaleon. Jess was volunteering at the Pasadena Convention Center shortly after evacuation, and she found these photos scattered in some shrubs by the parking lot entrance for the Paseo.

These photos capture a family over the course of several years, from 1979 to 1985. This man was likely in his late twenties / early thirties at the time these photos were taken, meaning that he's likely in his sixties or seventies now.

Based on the state of these items when they were found (see last photo), we believe that the owner evacuated to the convention center in the early aftermath of the fire, parked at the Paseo, and dropped these items as they were heading across the street.

Here‚Äôs what we know about the owner based on what‚Äôs in this collection: they‚Äôre an electrician; they had a grey pet cat in the 1980s; they traveled to Massachusetts in autumn 1979; they hiked Havasupai in October 1983; one of the brothers in the family was married around 1985; the groom or the bride was most likely Jewish; also in 1985 they went to the LA Zoo and The Huntington with their mother.

All photos appear to have been taken in the Pasadena / Glendale / Burbank area.

We are trying to reunite these photos with their owner. Please get in touch if you recognize this woman. These photos will be kept safe until the owner is identified.

There is a lot more going on with Andrew in the neighborhood and how we met for the first time, the second time, and probably the third time.  Third is the charm though. I‚Äôve said it before but stories don‚Äôt start and stop, they develop and linger and then run off into oblivion, but they definitely don‚Äôt end. And the bookends that used to hold the books upright on the shelf, even the metal ones, burned in the fire so why let anything try to sit and behave like it‚Äôs still normal.  Altadena will get back to normal and there is progress everyday to get there.  I believe! There is also a 3rd generation truck we need to get at. We will get there. Stay tuned.

Our officers played a crucial role in mutual aid operations, supporting the Pasadena and Sierra Madre evacuation efforts, property protection, and crime suppression.

During this historically destructive event, our officers demonstrated unwavering commitment, working tirelessly to safeguard the communities we serve, as well as the animals and properties at risk. The foundation and association ensured that not only the El Monte Police Department but also other agencies were well-equipped, providing essential meals and water to first responders on the front lines.

We are especially grateful for the incredible leadership of @chiefjakefisher , who leads from the front with integrity and commitment to public safety. His support of all our foundations ventures and initiatives has been invaluable.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the City Council and City Manager @citymanager.almamartinez for recognizing the vital role of first responders, including police foundations and associations. Your acknowledgment strengthens our resolve to continue serving with integrity and dedication.

I had already noticed it because it's displaying such a sweet, positive, caring message on the fence, and it's located on such a prominent corner, standing out for all to see. 

Alexia told me it's her mother's house, and boasts a very long history, starting in 1913 when it was built for the founder of Balboa Island!

it's important to note that I took these pictures when I was photographing a house directly across the street for my Eaton fire chimney project. That house burned right to the ground‚Ä¶

I plan on trying to dig up more information about this pretty place, and would love to hear more from you as well, Alexia. 

Thank you for being so kind as to get in touch. I think it's important to celebrate the homes in Altadena, that made it through that destructive fire storm. This house is still standing and exudes a strong message of hope for the future of the community.

I just got the hit to put down my phone and tap out of social media for a bit. So that I can truly feel IN and then move OUT of this massive metamorphosis that I AM currently very much IN. When you lose everything, you have the opportunity to build from the ground up. Both literally and metaphorically.
And I am quite busy doing both of those while also being a very hands on Mom and wife. 
This life changing plot twist deserves a heightened level of respect and honor ‚öîÔ∏è 
This is such a gift even amidst the gutting heartbreaküêõ
And I want to fully embrace it all, not bypass any important steps or the exquisite silence with myself ü¶ã
Time is my most precious commodity. 
I no longer feel the desire to give it away so freely right now. I mostly do enjoy social media but it all feels very dull and boring to me at the moment (it‚Äôs me not you). And so I am not going to force myself. I always orient myself towards FREEDOM and this is no different. 
So I‚Äôll be back when I‚Äôm back.
There will be much to share soon enough. 
Love ya‚Äôll!

As fires burned in January, organizations like @DirectRelief rushed in to help, and continue to help today. 

Amgen and the Amgen Foundation supported this effort through a donation of $10 million which went to wildfires relief efforts led by the @CalFund, the @launitedway, and Direct Relief.

Headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, Amgen and its employees have called Southern California its home for more than four decades and its connection to the community runs deep.

As the road to recovery continues, we remain committed to helping these communities rebuild.

Also, the average sales price is up $24,000, and for the first time lots that have sold and that are in escrow exceed active lot listings (40 sold/in escrow versus 37 active).

We had a surprise Five Acres Hero Award to one of our own: Five Acres Director of Facilities Jake Cashill. Our CEO Chanel Boutakidis shared how he worked around the clock to save the historic main building during the Eaton Fires, watering the roofs and monitoring the fires 24 hours a day. He repaired the damage from the windstorms and ensured the organization was safe for the return of the children in the Residential program and the staff, working with staff and volunteers during our Five Acres Snow White Cleanup Day. Thank you, Jake, for your big heart and being our hero!

Francis Polytechnic High School,"Tonight, neighbors from Sun Valley, Arleta, North Hollywood, Shadow Hills, and beyond came together for the Phase 2 cleanup hearing of the Eaton and Palisades fires and their impact on Sun Valley as it houses some of the city landfills. City and business representatives outlined the process, fielding community concerns‚Äîthough, as expected, responses felt scripted and lacked the depth and reassurance many hoped for.

Still, we recognize the importance of showing up. Town hall meetings can be uncomfortable for officials facing passionate residents, but their presence matters. More importantly, your presence matters. To everyone who attended, asked questions, and advocated for their health‚Äîthank you! Your voices remind us that our community does care about its exposure to toxins, and that fuels us to keep showing up, too.

As a health- and sustainability-focused coffee cart in a neighborhood with few clean food options, tonight reignited our hope. Beyond these hearings, we encourage all of us to reflect: How can we minimize toxin exposure in our daily lives? Fires are an unfortunate reality in our region, and the materials in our homes‚Äîplastics, synthetic fibers, and chemical-laden goods‚Äîcan release harmful toxins not just when burned but also when simply un packaging or worse, with daily use. Even if they don‚Äôt burn down, they still pollute our landfills and air over time.

As consumers, we vote with our dollars. Invest in natural, toxin-free products, avoid plastic-heavy goods, and choose organic whole foods when possible. Small choices add up. Because protecting our community isn‚Äôt just about cleanup‚Äîit‚Äôs about prevention.

Charlie James Gallery is proud to announce an upcoming solo exhibition by Mary Anna Pomonis opening in December of 2025. This powerful new body of work reimagines paintings by Mary Anna lost in the Eaton Fire, transforming loss into creation. Mary Anna had opened a solo show of new paintings in Altadena just days before the fires, all of which were lost. 

Pomonis is known for her airbrushed geometric abstractions, which explore the intersections of sacred geometry, feminine empowerment, and optical illusion. Her work bridges historical symbolism with contemporary technique, creating paintings that exist between dimensionality and flatness, meditation and movement.

This exhibition marks a profound return‚Äîeach piece a reconstruction, a new beginning forged from the embers of the past.

These photos come from one collection of 268 photographs, dozens of negatives, and notebooks found by @jesspantaleon. Jess was volunteering at the Pasadena Convention Center shortly after evacuation, and she found these photos scattered in some shrubs by the parking lot entrance for the Paseo.

These photos capture one family over the course of several years, from 1979 to 1985. Based on the state of these items when they were found, we believe that the owner evacuated to the convention center in the early aftermath of the fire, parked at the Paseo, and dropped these items as they were heading across the street. All photos appear to have been taken in the Pasadena / Glendale / Burbank area.

Based on the significant number of photos taken in front of the Valentino store, we believe this woman's last name could be Valentino, or that she worked there. There certainly appears to be a reason they took photos in front of Valentino as opposed to any other store. 

Here‚Äôs what we know about the owner based on what‚Äôs in this collection: they‚Äôre an electrician; they had a grey pet cat in the 1980s; they traveled to Massachusetts in autumn 1979; they hiked Havasupai in October 1983; one of the brothers in the family was married around 1985; the groom or the bride was most likely Jewish; also in 1985 they went to the LA Zoo and The Huntington with a woman who appears to be their mother.

We are trying to reunite these photos with their owners. Please get in touch if you recognize these people. These photos will be kept safe until the owner is identified.

Irving J. Gill, architect
 - In 1910, after ten years of experimentation with small but efficient worker housing, Irving J. Gill designed Belle Vista Terrace (aka Lewis Court). The project uses a single-bedroom cottage floor plan he had earlier developed in San Diego. Here, he assembled several cottages built around a landscaped courtyard as a collection of units. Each cottage is designed for both privacy and shared common space and incorporates many of his fireproofing design innovations. Belle Vista Terrace has been identified as the first courtyard housing project in Southern California to use a central shared garden, a layout that would become ubiquitous in Los Angeles and San Diego in the 1910s and 1920s. 
 - While the courtyard has since been filled in with insensitive additions, Belle Vista Terrace still stands today as an example of very early Los Angeles Modernism. In January 2025, just a block away, Belle Vista Terrace recently survived the Eaton Fire that ravaged the nearby San Gabriel Mountains, seen in the images, and destroyed much of Altadena, just west of Sierra Madre.

He has a knife sharpening shop very close to the burn line near where my house is still standing intact in appearance but uninhabitable due to soot, ash, smoke damage, and water contamination. Johnny took me by surprise with his stories of the merchant marines, the Philippines, and his impromptu knife training/disarming demonstrations‚Äîbut what really got me was when he showed me the knives that my neighbors are bringing to him from the ashes of their homes. I watched him hammer and expertly recondition the blades with master precision. In conjunction with a neighborhood woodworker they are giving new life to these objects and something that their owners can tangibly use as they rebuild their everyday world. If you are in Los Angeles I highly recommend paying a visit to Johnny Sousa to patronize his knife sharpening business at 370 E. Woodbury Road, Pasadena at the ACE hardware building.

When you meet Brian you are instantly taken away to another world that has nothing to do with burned cars, homes, or our savaged Altadena.  It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to post the images of his bombed out Boss Hog Cadillac, the remnants of his insane whiskey bar with his (The Original) infinity barrel or the ashes of his Pulp Fiction inspired art works and memorabilia.  You know Brian about 30 seconds before you meet him for the first time.  His cheer, friendliness, and his humor is infectious and it arrives before you do.  He knows how to use the most precise words to express exactly how he and everyone in this situation is feeling.  If he happens to be a salesman for a living, I‚Äôll have everything in his portfolio, twice. I envy his spirit because in spite of all this bullshit, that he and his family have endured, he is still shockingly present, full of love and full of pure joy.

We know there‚Äôs a lot of gatekeeping and ego in the road bike male-driven cycling scene. Too much road bike-shaming, too many people acting like they were never beginners. Not here. This ride is for those who have been pushed away by that culture‚Äîfor the road cycling-curious, the long-distance hopefuls, those on a health journey, for non-male riders, and anyone looking for a safe, ego-free space to learn and road ride.

Maybe you‚Äôre riding a vintage steel bike, a $10k dream build, or something you got secondhand. No matter what you ride, if you‚Äôre looking for an open and supportive cycling space, this is your ride.

What to Expect:

‚úÖ No egos. No bike shaming. No dumb questions.
‚úÖ A no-drop pace‚Äîeveryone stays together.
‚úÖ Seasoned riders to answer questions.
‚úÖ Social ride + space to learn road cycling basics.
‚úÖ Women, POC, non-binary, femme, lgbtq, cyclists encouraged to join.

üì£ Q&A can be asked privately to our seasoned riders or ask out loud! 

üö≤ All you need is a road bike, a helmet, and an open mind. Let‚Äôs build something together.

Like so many others, they lost their charming Altadena home in the Eaton fire.

Pat was used to seeing fire and experiencing dangerous winds in the area, so he had found a place for them to stay in advance - super prepared! But what they did not expect was that the house wouldn't be there the next day. That was absolutely out of the question.
 
And that next day was Daniel's 16th birthday, and the family Subaru was secretly to be his. As you can see, that didn't work out. 

The day we met was the first time they'd all been back together on the site, so they were looking for some buried treasure and found a few things‚Ä¶ Some beads from Stella's collection, a small glass bear.

For Stella, one of the worst aspects of this was losing her various crafts including beaded jewelry projects. 

Both Pat and his wife, Alison, are educators. Pat is retired but Alison continues to teach composition and literature. I asked whether it's too difficult to continue working at this time, but she said that, in a way, it's helpful - takes her mind off of things for a few hours‚Ä¶

The bright green area in the back was their Potted designed garden and next to it, an almost-finished beautiful architectural ADU with gorgeous wood details. 

And despite all this loss, so many smiles. This is such a lovely family and I felt honored to spend the time with them and hear their stories.

If you know someone who might like to be photographed with what remains of their home, or just have me photograph what's there, see the link in my bio to the Eaton fire Chimney project. Time is of the essence, three sites I went to yesterday had already been bulldozed, so I was not able to document the tile fireplaces for @savethetiles, which is another one of my activities in the area these days.

Please join me in sending best wishes to this family.  And if someone has a connection with Subaru, this is their moment to do a great deed for a very deserving young man.

Why? On his property sits my dream car, a 1967 Mustang Fastback. I fell for her when I was a kid, I‚Äôve told this story before. @isaacnceja knows all about my love for her, he even started his story for @laopinionla about the fastback. I‚Äôm not going to act like he didn‚Äôt show me that love on purpose. Isaac and I have a lot in common, we do most things on purpose, for a purpose, with a purpose and let others feel the energy to figure out the message. I happen to reach Jim the morning Isaac showed up. ‚ú®The timing ‚ú®. He was the last interview of the day which ended during our beautiful Altadena golden hour. Even more special now, since those golden bubbles started rising up over all the burned lots of Altadena. So ready with love that as they connect with each other, the growth turns exponential. Love scales over the planet and into the cosmos and beyond into Gods newest creation billions of light years away. 
Altadena scales via the Stardust of its dream. The same stardust that is the make up of our bodies, the natural world and the cars we love so much. We are made of the things of the Universe. And we are the Universe staring back at itself. There is a giant cosmic mirror starring you down, everyday and all day. It just needs some polishing now and then. And when you do that, you can see Jim who was building this car for his son‚Äôs 16th birthday. What a gift that would have been to the both them. And look again into the mirror and you can see Isaac.  You can see Carl, and Max, and Lauren, Rodney, Danny, Junior, the Jacksons, Sean, Kenny, Sergio, Sarah, Juan Carlos, Anabela, Greg, Keni, Robert, Greg, Kenneth, Brian, Rick, the Cooleys, Rebecca, Holden, Harry and my brother my mother my father the entire town of Altadena and beyond.

Sponsored by Social Compassion in Legislation, the bill was inspired by the heartwarming story of Oreo, as seen on the Today Show, a Pomeranian who went missing during the Palisades Fire and survived for five days in the debris before being reunited with his owner.

‚ÄúPets are more than just property‚Äîthey are family. When disaster strikes, no one should have to choose between their safety and their pet‚Äôs survival,‚Äù said Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur. ‚ÄúThe FOUND Act ensures that local governments have clear rescue plans in place, so pet owners don‚Äôt have to risk their lives to save their animals. While we‚Äôve seen incredible examples of fire and safety officials working alongside the public to reunite pets with their families, as well as the extraordinary efforts of local animal shelters and rescuers, we owe it to pet owners across California to ensure that every city and county has a plan in place before disaster strikes.‚Äù

‚ÄúTime and time again, we‚Äôve seen animals abandoned or lost in the chaos of wildfires and other disasters,‚Äù said Judie Mancuso, Founder and President of Social Compassion in Legislation. ‚ÄúThis bill is about making sure animal family members are not left behind. Our beloved companion animals are not like a pair of prescription glasses, they are sentient beings that must be rescued. The bill provides the necessary tools to coordinate rescues, support evacuees, and reunite families with their beloved animals.‚Äù

Investigators are delving into the potential cause of the devastating Eaton Fire that ravaged Los Angeles County, destroying nearly 10,000 structures. The primary focus is on whether the fire was sparked by a disused ‚Äúzombie‚Äù power line ‚Äî old, non-functional power lines that were not fully decommissioned but left in place.

The fire, which has already caused widespread destruction and displaced thousands, continues to raise questions about infrastructure safety and the consequences of neglecting decommissioned equipment. Authorities are working diligently to determine if the ‚Äúzombie‚Äù power line played a role in igniting the deadly blaze.

As the investigation unfolds, local residents and officials alike are hoping for answers to prevent such tragedies in the future.

And then grief entered the room.

Loss doesn‚Äôt just take what‚Äôs gone. It reshapes what remains‚Äîincluding your relationships. Suddenly, the person who once felt like home feels just a little bit foreign. Not because the love is gone, but because pain changes the way we connect.

Maybe you‚Äôve felt it too.
‚Ä®One of you shuts down, the other reaches out.‚Ä®One of you needs words, the other needs space.‚Ä®One of you is still tangled in the past, the other is trying to move forward.

And if you‚Äôre not careful, the space between you turns into distance.

This week, we‚Äôre talking about:

* What to do when you and your partner grieve at different speeds.
* How to keep resentment from creeping in.
* How to stay close when pain makes you push each other away.

Because love isn‚Äôt about working through things the same way. 

It‚Äôs about choosing to deal with life together. ‚Ä®

For lovers of classic design and enduring materials, Altadena‚Äôs historic tile fireplaces are a masterclass.

Ernest A. Batchelder, a pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement, began producing hand-crafted tiles in 1910. His early creations drew on Medieval, Renaissance, and Art Nouveau themes, often featuring intricate low-relief patterns with muted earth tones and blue accents achieved through a single-fire engobe process. Batchelder‚Äôs tiles became synonymous with fireplaces, fountains, and architectural details in both residential and commercial spaces. 

Today Batchelder tiles along with his contemporaries, Claycraft Potteries, Gladding-McBean, and California Faience tiles remain celebrated as iconic elements of Altadena‚Äôs architectural legacy.

Because all of these tiles were kiln fired, they survived the Eaton Canyon fire that burned virtually everything around them. In the burn area today, brick chimneys and tile fireplace surrounds are often all that is left as clean up begins along these burn sites.

@savethetiles is leading a momentous effort to rescue, repair, and restore these irreplaceable tiles from the devastation of the Eaton fire and return these beautiful tiles to Altadenans at no cost to homeowners.

Learn more about @savethetiles and support their GoFundMe through the link in my bio. If you‚Äôre interested in volunteering with their effort (or if you‚Äôve lost your home and would like them to recover your fireplace‚Äôs tiles), please fill out the forms on their website, www.savethetiles.org. Let‚Äôs ensure these classic materials continue to grace Altadena‚Äôs homes for generations.

Today‚Äôs second episode, takes us to Venice to meet Nina Evtuhov, a sought-after session violinist whose house burned down in the Palisades on January 7th. Nina‚Äôs on more than 400 film and tv scores, from Frozen to Star Wars to Indiana Jones to all the new Star Trek TV shows. Plus, she was in the pit for lots of Broadway shows, like The Boy from Oz, Oklahoma, and Les Miz. Losing everything in the fire means rebuilding her life again, because Nina‚Äôs husband died in 2010, leaving her to raise her two daughters.

What once felt effortless now feels uncertain. The person who knew you best suddenly feels just out of reach. Not because love disappeared, but because loss changes how we hold each other.

One of the hardest parts of navigating grief isn‚Äôt just what you‚Äôve lost‚Äî it‚Äôs figuring out how to stay close to the people who remain.

That‚Äôs why we created ‚ÄúWhen Loss Rearranges Love: How to Navigate Hard Things Together.‚Äù A guide for anyone feeling the quiet distance that grief can bring.

Inside, you‚Äôll find:

‚ú® The invisible divide that makes loss feel lonely‚Äîeven in love.
‚ú® How grieving styles clash‚Äîand what to do when your partner processes differently.
‚ú® The 5 Loss Languages‚Äîhow to support someone without losing yourself.
‚ú® How to hold space for each other‚Äîeven when words feel impossible.

Because love doesn‚Äôt have to be a casualty of loss.

It can bend, stretch, and reshape itself into something even stronger‚Äî if we learn how to meet each other in the middle.

Comment ‚ÄúGuide‚Äù and I‚Äôll DM you the resource. 
 
Heads up: If you don‚Äôt receive the guide, double-check that you‚Äôre following me‚Äîsometimes DM‚Äôs get blocked from going through otherwise.

I‚Äôm finding the burn path of the fire pretty interesting as well. I know it started at the back of the house and then the back wall of the garage collapsed forward into it. Certain areas saw hotter burn than others and things really scatter around from a fire.

While helping a friend to design a new home to replace the one lost in the Eaton fire, I've spent a lot of time in the devastated neighborhoods of Altadena.

 Neither a photograph nor a sketch can really capture the dramatic nature of the loss of so many homes. Over 9,000 structures were burned to the ground. The above sketch is of just one of the homes that was lost in the blink of an eye.

The records, filed with the state of California, reveal that pending work orders existed for the electrical towers spanning Eaton Canyon, where the fire is thought to have originated. These orders reportedly included clearing vegetation that could pose a fire hazard.

Authorities are still gathering evidence, and dozens of lawsuits have been filed in connection to the wildfire, which caused significant destruction. Investigations are ongoing as officials work to determine the extent of SCE‚Äôs responsibility in the disaster.

This has been a deeply traumatic experience, but your photos give us a moment to pause, remembering the good times even as we grieve what we‚Äôve lost. The light and warmth in your photographs don‚Äôt just capture the scene‚Äîthey bring a sense of hope, reminding us that even in loss, there is still beauty.
Thank you for doing this.

Price per SF of closed lots dropped to $57 per SF, down from last week's $62 per SF, likely due to larger lots closing. Also, the average sales price fell from last week's $623,000 to this week's $595,000. Similarly to last week, lots that have sold and that are in escrow exceed active lot listings (50 sold/in escrow versus 40 active). This suggests buyer activity is strong and demand is still high. Approximately 90 lots have been listed so far in Altadena since late January.

Their flowers always in bloom, the bees buzzing around and their people out and about or relaxing inside. 

This is what I think of when creating these home portraits. 

But each one was lost to our dear city in the January fires. 

I love hearing the stories told to me from the homeowners and friends. They‚Äôre a look into someone‚Äôs life, a detail that we all could relate to. 

Like Sea Dojo, a nickname name given by a child who misses his home, or the little sapling in a yard planted in honor of a family tragedy.

These are just 17 of my 1500 and growing list, but each one is so very special to someone.

My name is Asher Bingham, I‚Äôm drawing homes lost in the LA Fires in January. I have 17 volunteer artists helping me tackle this giant outpouring for art that can heal, follow my stories to see little insights, hear stories and also see other volunteer artwork as I receive them.

Altadena, a place where history whispered through tree-lined streets and century-old homes, faced unimaginable devastation when the Eaton Fire tore through on January 7, 2025. More than 9,000 structures were lost, and the landscape of this beloved town was forever changed.

Yet, even in the face of destruction, there are stories of hope. Today, Heather Eastwood and Ruslan Abaev will share their journey of overcoming the devastation of the Eaton Fire and standing strong in the aftermath. Their story is one of determination, of finding light in the darkest moments, and of a deep love for the place they call home.

This post was originally meant to be shared to bring awareness to the importance of supporting small businesses‚Äîbut now, it‚Äôs even more urgent. We just got the news that our building is up for sale.

Small businesses like Esquina are what make communities thrive. When you shop local, you‚Äôre not just buying a product‚Äîyou‚Äôre investing in people, culture, and the future of your neighborhood.

We‚Äôre grateful for everyone who has supported us, and now more than ever, we need to show up for the businesses that make our communities unique. We‚Äôll keep you updated on what‚Äôs next‚Äîstay with us.
